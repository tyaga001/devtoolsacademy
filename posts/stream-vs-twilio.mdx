# Twilio and Stream: Communication Solutions for Developers

When it comes to communication use cases, software developers often consider WebRTC or WebSockets. However, for additional features in communication, many turn to services like Twilio, which is popular in the industry. Let's dive deep into Twilio and Stream by creating an automated customer support bot.

Stream and Twilio these both products  serve as a solutions for devs to integrate communication usecase  into the  apps . but Stream is more suitable for real-time messaging and activity feeds, Twilio is a  communications platform which offers different services APIs like for SMS, voice, video, and chat.

Stream is mostly used for  in-app chat usecase , use cases like social media apps or e-commerce, and gaming applications.
Twilio is dope when it comes to  a multi-modal communication API provider

## Architecture and Scalability

**Stream architecture  :**  

you can say stream is a wrapper on **distributed event-driven architecture** optimized for high scale and low latency  **.** stream‚Äôs architecture design uses message queues and distributed data stores for managing the high-troughput communication , ensuring real-time delivery and synchronisation accross users .

**Tech Stack** :

 ****

- **Backend :** Go as a programming language (microservices) with the GRPC protocol .
- **Data Layer : cassandra for the data storage and**
- **Real time communication :**  WebSockets for low-latency communication
- **Event Streaming :**  Uses kafka for event propogation **accross system .**

**Twilio architecture  :**  

In the starting days of twilio . Twilio was using monoliths but as the product scales twilio shifts on muli-tenant cloud infra . twilio offers API for SMS , voice and chat through their globally distributed infra and reliability and the uptime these are most important things for the twilio for the critical communications.

![twilio architecture](https://tender-bugle-dd6.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffac3b9e2-153a-47fb-94bf-a917731986a0%2F586aa13e-7b69-4165-be4a-b8ab9739f83c%2Fimage.png?table=block&id=145518a2-f962-80a2-8593-f29d62d065e2&spaceId=fac3b9e2-153a-47fb-94bf-a917731986a0&width=1420&userId=&cache=v2)

**Tech Stack** :

 ****

- **Backend :**  javascript (NodeJS) and java mocroservices.
- **Data Layer : postgressSQL as a database and elasticsearch for anallytics,**
- **Global Infra  :**  for the low latency twilio utilizes their global infra and high available services

**Scalibility**

Stream handles millions of users , which is ideal for high-frequency use cases like chats and feeds .

twilio is damn good in multi-channel use case like call management

**Integrations  and capabilities**

### **Stream**

- **APIs:** REST and WebSocket APIs for real-time messaging.
- **SDKs:** Extensive support for mobile and web platforms like React, React Native, Flutter, etc.
- **Customizability:** Highly customizable UI components.

### **Twilio**

- **APIs:** REST APIs for SMS, Voice, and Chat.
- **SDKs:** Twilio Conversations SDKs for cross-channel messaging.
- **Multi-Channel:** SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, and email integration.

## performance and latency

### **Stream**

- **Latency:** it gives sub-50ms latency for real-time events.
- **Concurrency:** Optimized for 100k+ concurrent connections per channel.
- **Performance Tools:** Supports **load balancing** and **dynamic scaling** to ensure consistent performance.

### **Twilio**

- **Latency:** Generally it‚Äôs quite low for SMS and call delivery, real-time chat may have slightly higher latency than Stream.
- **Reliability:** Ensures 99.95% uptime SLA.
- **Optimization:** Global routing ensures minimal delays in message and voice delivery.

In the next section, we'll explore how to develop a customer support bot using these two services üëÄ


## Let‚Äôs cook Twillio customer support bot üßë‚Äçüç≥

let‚Äôs make sure you have prerequisites 

- Node.js and npm you will get here
- A Twilio account
- ngrok or localtunnel now-a-days my personal preference is localtunnel

## Clone existing SDK first

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/ipm-quickstart-node.git
cd ipm-quickstart-node
```
set up env variables 
  
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

grap the varaible from twilio
  
  ```bash
      TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=""
      TWILIO_API_KEY=""
      TWILIO_API_SECRET=""
  ```

When localtunnel is installed globally, just use the¬†`lt`¬†command to start the tunnel.

**configuring Twilio Sync**

Twilio Sync works out of the box, using default settings per account. Once you have your API keys configured, execute¬†`npm install; npm run start`¬†

**Twilio Chat**

**Webhook**

Before we decide whether to block or forward a message we will need to access the data that Twilio sends to our application.¬†To do that we first need to parse it first by adding (body-parser) to our project using npm:

```
npm install body-parser --save
```

Once the package is installed add it to¬†`index.js`:

```javascript
require('dotenv').load();
var http = require('http');
var path = require('path');
var AccessToken = require('twilio').AccessToken;
var IpMessagingGrant = AccessToken.IpMessagingGrant;
var express = require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var randomUsername = require('./randos');

// Create Express webapp
var app = express();
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.use(bodyParser.json({})) 
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
  extended: true
}));
```

```javascript
app.post('/message', function (req, res, next) {
  console.dir(req.body, { depth: 1 });
  res.sendStatus(200);
});

// Create http server and run it
var server = http.createServer(app);
var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(port, function() {
    console.log('Express server running on *:' + port);
});
```

setup the webhook endpoint with tunnel

```powershell
npm install -g localtunnel
```

now grab the exposed url and setup in the console of the twilio

## Programatically control the messaeges üíª

Now that you are receiving all the necessary information, we can dive deeper into the¬†[control](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/ip-messaging/webhooks#pre-processing)¬†that these webhooks provide.¬†If we return the status code 403 instead of 200 we can block the respective message.¬†Let‚Äôs alter the route to intercept and not deliver¬†messages¬†that start with¬†`/helloworld`:

but if we want to send our messages

```powershell
require('dotenv').load();
var http = require('http');
var path = require('path');
var Twilio = require('twilio');
var AccessToken = Twilio.AccessToken;
var IpMessagingGrant = AccessToken.IpMessagingGrant;
var express = require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var randomUsername = require('./randos');

var client = new Twilio.IpMessagingClient();
var service = client.services(process.env.TWILIO_IPM_SERVICE_SID);
var botName = 'hello';

// Create Express webapp
var app = express();
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.use(bodyParser.json({})) 
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
  extended: true
}));

app.get('/token', function(request, response) {

app.post('/message', function (req, res, next) {
    res.sendStatus(200);

    if (req.body.Body.toLowerCase().indexOf('/helloworld') === 0) {
        var channel = service.channels(req.body.ChannelSid);
        channel.members.create({
            identity: botName
        }).then(function (response) {
            return channel.messages.create({
                from: botName,
                body: req.body.message
            });
        }).then(function (response) {
            console.log('Bot message sent!');
        }).catch(function (err) {
            console.error('Failed to send message');
            console.error(err);
        });
    }
});

// Create http server and run it
var server = http.createServer(app);
var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(port, function() {
    console.log('Express server running on *:' + port);
});

```

**BOOM üí•**

That was all about twillio . let‚Äôs see stream

## customer support bot in stream

Here we are going to use react for creating the customer support bot with the help of stream 

so let‚Äôs start üöÄ

make sure you have installed `npm` 

`npx create-react-app getstream-bot`

Get the stream API key 

1. Visit¬†[**Stream**](https://getstream.io/chat/)¬†and register to get an API key.
2. For the purpose of this tutorial, we‚Äôll disable auth and permissions checks (note you should obviously not do this in a production app, but it allows you to focus on your chat experience instead of integrating your auth system). Open your¬†stream dashboard , click your app, select ‚Äú**Chat**‚Äù and disable authentication & permissions:

![stream dashboard](https://tender-bugle-dd6.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffac3b9e2-153a-47fb-94bf-a917731986a0%2F6fe4edbd-d471-48e5-8bca-db7b2667f634%2Fimage.png?table=block&id=147518a2-f962-80d8-bae8-f880645847a3&spaceId=fac3b9e2-153a-47fb-94bf-a917731986a0&width=1420&userId=&cache=v2)

let‚Äôs save the time to write the react code.

open the stream dashboard and copy the enviroment variables

by cloning the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GetStream/chatbot-tutorial.git
cd chatbot-tutorial
```

‚ö†Ô∏è make sure you are setting up enviroment variables by creating `.env.developement` file

```bash
REACT_APP_STREAM_API_KEY=replacewithyourstreamapikey
```

now run the project

```bash
cd chat-frontend
npm; npm start
```

the enviroment file should look like this 

```bash
STREAM_API_KEY=replacewithyourstreamapikey
STREAM_API_SECRET=secret
LUIS_APP_ID=appid
LUIS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=subscriptionkey
LUIS_REGION=westus
```

## key differences in these services

- **Setup  :- 
Twilio** : Twillio just procide the API for SMS and whatsapp like third party applications . it‚Äôs comparitvely easy because it‚Äôs consists of block coding (drag and drop) so any guy with no prior experience of coding can build something with twilio . is user want to implement AI chatbot then twilio simplifies integrationsusing webhook and it‚Äôs compatible with open ai

**Stream : it comes with SDK like react , react native , flutter e.t.c . stream is bascially designed for in app chat like functions . it requires real time messeging logic and auth which is mostly managing the ui**
- **Performance :-
Twilio : optimize for messaging platforms like SMS and WHATSAPP . it has slightlt high latency when it compare to stream and it‚Äôs performance is limited to messaging channels

Stream : Stream is optimized for real time coversation with low-latency. and stream is highly efficient for handeling users and messages it reauires to manage websockets for real time updates**
- **Pricing :-
Twilio :- Twilio is using strategy of pay when you used their serice i.e. the standar rate of one operation is fixed and that operation is performing n times then the cost will be n x rate**

![twilio pricing](https://tender-bugle-dd6.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffac3b9e2-153a-47fb-94bf-a917731986a0%2Fc61454eb-055b-4316-98b7-9cf6298c41d2%2Fimage.png?table=block&id=148518a2-f962-80fb-b035-de890d6ad357&spaceId=fac3b9e2-153a-47fb-94bf-a917731986a0&width=1420&userId=&cache=v2)

**Stream :**  
Stream : chages as a standerd SAAS I mean as per the month (subscribtion based)

| Feature | Twilio | Stream |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup | Block coding, API-based, easier for non-developers | SDK-based, requires coding knowledge, built for in-app chat |
| Performance | Higher latency, optimized for SMS/WhatsApp | Low latency, optimized for real-time chat |
| Pricing Model | Pay-per-use based on operations | Subscription-based monthly pricing |
| Best For | SMS, WhatsApp, external messaging | In-app chat, real-time messaging |
| Integration | Webhook-based, third-party friendly | Native SDK integration, WebSocket based |

## Conclsion :

I will say both service are equally good it totally depend on the developer requirment which service to choose for the communication

for e.g.

if you want a third party integration like whatsapp then go for the twilio and if you want in app chat then that tmie go for the stream . if you are ok with manage chatbot logic seperately this is a good case for stream and if your logic is preimpletned and the priority is the set easy NLP / chatbot logic then in this case twilio is quite good

thanks a lot for sticking to the end . here are few important links
