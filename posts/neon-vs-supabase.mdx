casey=>
```
This method is secure and efficient, eliminating the need to remember or manage passwords.


#### 3. Secure connections<a id="3-secure-connections"></a>

Neon requires SSL/TLS encryption for all connections to ensure data security. The `sslmode` parameter in the connection string allows various levels of security: 

****![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXflUDcgA-jBxuqN4vQDlQfIFkcP_4sEeMpINOG07nsH-yV0LKZsx9hgS2YarO9S_JnwDdwUPYpyQ6msH0uiZ1lJk-WdHe8vH6H-AkPhHEKA-h2D2hOiqSc20T0bhs34WnsSSQPuzSqLVj7rWITVTE9Quyrw?key=0jnpRzNFQaBNrbdOAncbMA)****

Neon recommends using **verify-full** mode for maximum security. Configure SSL settings according to your client library (e.g., psycopg2 for Python) and ensure your root certificates are correctly set up.


#### 4. GUI applications<a id="4-gui-applications"></a>

You can connect to Neon databases from various GUI applications and IDEs like pgAdmin, DataGrip, and DBeaver.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXefqWIBPCZJnoVb3jTzT4CoSORO7RPGQVnyiev5Rhj2qThjR6RxyVYkZJ5XUgJngdRdS7y_HteiwhkDNNmpzymlXz8HjCOjWaojGIEfQXGcKoFadoWsj8jegB9sddloTm1TJHhuXscxQsbGe6yzRBYd5hg?key=0jnpRzNFQaBNrbdOAncbMA)

You need to gather your connection details from the Neon Console and enter them into the appropriate fields in your application. Neon supports both pooled and direct connections.


#### 5. Connection pooling<a id="5-connection-pooling"></a>

> Neon uses **PgBouncer** for connection pooling, supporting up to 10,000 concurrent connections. This is particularly useful for applications with many simultaneous connections, such as serverless functions. Use a pooled connection string by adding `-pooler` to your compute endpoint ID.

**Example pooled connection string:**

```bash
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Connection pooling helps manage resources efficiently, allowing many connections to share a smaller number of actual Postgres connections.

#### 6. Connecting to Neon with psql<a id="6-connecting-to-neon-with-psql"></a>

> The psql client is the native command-line interface for PostgreSQL. It allows users to interact with their PostgreSQL databases by running queries, executing commands, and performing various database operations. Since Neon runs on PostgreSQL, psql is fully compatible with it. This compatibility ensures that you can leverage all standard PostgreSQL features while using Neon. The easiest way to connect to Neon using psql is with a connection string. You can obtain a connection string from the Connection Details widget on the Neon Dashboard.<a id="the-psql-client-is-the-native-command-line-interface-for-postgresql-it-allows-users-to-interact-with-their-postgresql-databases-by-running-queries-executing-commands-and-performing-various-database-operations-since-neon-runs-on-postgresql-psql-is-fully-compatible-with-it-this-compatibility-ensures-that-you-can-leverage-all-standard-postgresql-features-while-using-neon-the-easiest-way-to-connect-to-neon-using-psql-is-with-a-connection-string-you-can-obtain-a-connection-string-from-the-connection-details-widget-on-the-neon-dashboard"></a>

### Supabase Connection Methods<a id="supabase-connection-methods"></a>

Supabase offers multiple options for programmatically connecting to your Postgres database, catering to various use cases and environments:

1\. APIs

Supabase provides several types of API to suit your preference and allows you to programmatically connect to your Postgres database.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcOtm4ng3ENWd1NBgQ7kHBazxRXRoEoLj1OcvYucZ_D5-YPjcn3JubrbEnueKQGUI0EndFowGUddIs7ShO6hbTdv4FKz3dnbG_pH9Y0wghUlmJFPiDQpTbaQ7SLlzwNpkEr6H1j14iV8VRkIVgqPpAMFlA-?key=0jnpRzNFQaBNrbdOAncbMA)

- **REST:** Interact with your database through a REST interface.

- **GraphQL:** Interact with your database through a GraphQL interface.

- **Realtime:** Listen to database changes over websockets.

2\. Connection Pooling

A connection pool is a system (external to Postgres) that manages Postgres connections. Every Supabase project comes with a connection pooler for managing connections to your database.

****![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd8gmGlK7rew-pNmLc-zX9JJe8rJ0DzgH51RIfwu6rqbDCOOmjbUwItJzv1EJeD_ZfRRXdeh585zyxKiAzpJiPhwlUl5VI4k6lYZWgFKDoKJfLYG2taJcRaflWe7cHz0GSpr2CDavvtCRdjZUaey_TjYr76?key=0jnpRzNFQaBNrbdOAncbMA)****

The connection pooler is available in 2 modes: **Transaction** and **Session**.

- **Transaction mode:** Recommended for serverless environments where connections are assigned for the duration of a transaction.

- **Session mode:** Similar to direct connections, with a connection assigned until the client disconnects and full support for prepared statements.

3\. Direct connections

> Supabase allows direct connections to your Postgres database, typically via IPv6. For networks that require IPv4, Supabase offers connection pooling or an IPv4 add-on.

4\. Serverless environments

> Supabase provides several options for connecting to your Postgres database from serverless environments. The `supabase-js` client uses the auto-generated REST API, making it ideal for serverless workloads due to its built-in connection pooler that can handle thousands of simultaneous requests.

5\. Vercel edge functions

Choose one of these Vercel Deploy Templates, which use Vercel deploy integration to automatically configure your connection strings as environment variables on your Vercel project!

- **Supabase-js:** A Next.js App Router template configured with cookie-based auth using Supabase, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

- **Kysely:** A simple Next.js template that uses Supabase as the database and Kysely as the query builder.

Ensure the `Use connection pooler `option is checked, and `Transaction mode` is selected in your Database Settings. Now copy the URI and save it as the `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable, replacing the password placeholder with your actual database password and adding the suffix `?workaround=supabase-pooler.vercel`**.**

```bash
POSTGRES_URL="postgres://postgres.cfcxynqnhdybqtbhjemm:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?workaround=supabase-pooler.vercel"
```

## Architecture Comparison: Neon vs. Supabase<a id="architecture-comparison-neon-vs-supabase"></a>

### Neon Architecture<a id="neon-architecture"></a>

Neon's architecture is based on the separation of compute and storage, managed by the Neon Control Plane. This control plane orchestrates cloud resources across both storage and compute. Neon runs Postgres as a stateless compute, while storage is a multi-tenant key-value store for Postgres pages, custom-built for the cloud.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcZleav34itKB6Ja5zEF_73EEx59HdStYz1abL0Ncnq9blyc50G6MeEEr_hCLjhhJRU_Ezb2VshmfZz4E2iQwFVSNr6axCO58MQV48Cqb4TmfeE73jZAYJS2q87oGyEuZ2MXk25qTMI7nd3H2mppDBvt9TJ?key=0jnpRzNFQaBNrbdOAncbMA)

**Primary Components of Neon**

**1. Neon compute lifecycle**

> Neon compute nodes are stateless, with states transitioning between Active and Idle to manage resources efficiently. The Autosuspend feature ensures that computes do not remain active when not in use, conserving energy and resources. Activation of idle computes may introduce initial latency, but the system is designed to handle this efficiently.

**2. Neon storage**

> Neon uses a multi-tenant key-value store for Postgres pages, consisting of Safekeepers, Pageservers, and cloud object storage.

**3. Safekeepers**

> Ensure the durability of recent updates by storing the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) until processed by Pageservers and uploaded to cloud storage.

**4. Pageservers**

> Serve read requests by processing the incoming WAL stream into a custom storage format, uploading data to cloud storage, and downloading it on demand.

**5. Cloud object storage**

> Neon uses cloud object storage for long-term data storage, with data encrypted at rest.

**6. Compute configuration**

> Only session-level configuration parameters can be modified, resetting when the session terminates or when the compute suspends due to inactivity.


### Supabase Architecture<a id="supabase-architecture"></a>

- Supabase is built on open-source tools designed to be scalable and easy to use.

- Supabase is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. While Supabase aims to offer many of the features that Firebase provides, its approach is different, focusing on open-source technologies and supporting existing tools whenever possible.

- Supabase uses open-source tools that are scalable and simple to use. The platform leverages PostgreSQL rather than a NoSQL store, a deliberate choice to ensure the functionality and scalability required to compete with Firebase and go beyond it.

- Supabase aims to make PostgreSQL easy to use for everyone, regardless of their level of experience. Users can start small and grow into using more advanced features of PostgreSQL at their own pace.

**3. GoTrue (Auth)**

> A JWT-based API for managing users and issuing access tokens, integrating with PostgreSQL's Row Level Security and API servers.

**4. PostgREST (API)**

> A standalone web server that turns your PostgreSQL database into a RESTful API. It is used with the `pg_graphql` extension to provide a GraphQL API.

**5. Realtime (API & Multiplayer)**

> A scalable websocket engine for managing user presence, broadcasting messages, and streaming database changes.

**6. Storage API (Large file storage)**

> An S3-compatible object storage service that stores metadata in PostgreSQL.

**7. Deno (Edge functions)**

> A modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, providing serverless functions with low latency.

**8. postgres-meta (Database management)**

> A RESTful API for managing PostgreSQL, including fetching tables, adding roles, and running queries.

**9. Supavisor**

> A cloud-native, multi-tenant Postgres connection pooler designed for managing connections efficiently.

- Neon and Supabase both offer robust solutions for schema migrations, but their approaches differ significantly. Neon provides detailed guides for various frameworks such as Django, Laravel, and Entity Framework, ensuring seamless integration and easy migration processes.

- On the other hand, Supabase primarily utilizes the Supabase CLI for migrations, which is particularly useful for upgrading older projects or Postgres versions. The CLI allows users to perform database dumps and restores, set environment variables, and handle manual configurations such as enabling extensions and managing encryption keys. Since Supabase is just vanilla Postgres, it can also be used with popular migration tools available in frameworks such as Django, Laravel, and Entity. 


### Network restrictions<a id="network-restrictions"></a>

- Neon provides IP allowlists and protected branches, allowing users to restrict access to trusted IP addresses for increased security. Users can manage IP restrictions through the Neon console, ensuring only authorized connections to their databases.

- Supabase allows you to set up configurable IP range restrictions for database connections, which are managed via the dashboard or CLI, enhancing security. These restrictions apply to both IPv4 and IPv6, HTTPS APIs like PostgREST, Storage, and Auth rate limits and IP restrictions are configured separately.


### Branching<a id="branching"></a>

As mentioned earlier, Neon offers branching for development, testing, and data recovery. It allows the creation and management of branches through various tools like the Neon Console, CLI, API, GitHub Actions, and Vercel. This feature enables safe experimentation and streamlined workflows, ensuring project stability.

Supabase also provides branching for safe experimentation with project changes, similar to Git branches. Each branch has its own instance and API credentials. Branches are created via GitHub integration, allowing testing of configurations, schemas, and features without affecting production.


### Monitoring<a id="monitoring"></a>

> Neon and Supabase both offer robust monitoring capabilities for managing and optimizing database performance, though their approaches vary. Neon provides a comprehensive monitoring dashboard that tracks metrics such as CPU, RAM, and connections. Users can also monitor billing, usage, and autoscaling activities through the Neon Console, API, or CLI.

Both platforms support third-party tools like PgHero and PgAdmin for advanced performance analytics, and the **pg\_stat\_statements** extension helps optimize query performance. In addition, Supabase offers the newer **pg\_stat\_monitor**. 

Supabase, on the other hand, integrates monitoring tools within its CLI, allowing users to inspect their Postgres databases for issues like disk storage bloat, cache hit rates, and query performance.


### Backups<a id="backups"></a>

Neon and Supabase offer distinct approaches to database backups, catering to different needs. Neon supports point-in-time restore (PITR) with configurable retention periods: 24 hours for Free Tier, 7 days for Launch, and 30 days for Scale plans. Users can create database branches for near-instant restores. 

Additionally, backups can be manually created using command below.

Automation can be set up using GitHub Actions for nightly backups to AWS S3.

```bash
npx @neondatabase/pg-import --source <source_database_connection_string> --backup-file-path <dump_file_name>
```

Supabase also provides automated daily backups and PITR, with daily backups accessible for 7 days on Pro plans and 30 days on Enterprise plans.

For databases over 40GB, physical backups are used, ensuring performance with minimal disruption. PITR, available as an add-on, allows recovery to any point in time with high granularity, suitable for projects requiring stringent Recovery Point Objectives (RPO). Supabase uses pg\_dumpall for daily backups and WAL-G for PITR, ensuring data integrity and efficient disaster recovery
