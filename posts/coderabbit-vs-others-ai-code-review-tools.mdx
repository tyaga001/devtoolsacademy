## **What is Code Review**

> The term “code review” can refer to various activities, from simply reading code over your teammate’s shoulder to a 10-person meeting where you dissect code line by line. I use the term to refer to a formal and written process, but not so heavyweight as a series of in-person code inspection meetings.

In this article, I’ll compare AI code review tools such as [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/), [Bito AI Code Review Agent](https://bito.ai/product/ai-code-review-agent/), [CodeAnt AI](https://www.codeant.ai/), and [Korbit AI](https://www.korbit.ai/).

The article will compare the AI code review tools based on factors such as:

* Integration with development tools
* Code quality analysis
* Actionable code suggestions
* Chat functionality
* Security and privacy
* Pricing model

Before we explore the AI code review tools, let's see an overview of each AI tool.

## **On Overview**

As developers, we all know how important it is to have multiple sets of eyes review our code to identify potential issues and bugs and address them early. However, the traditional code review process can be time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to human bias.

> With 15 years in tech and participating in many code reviews, I observed several pain points I shared in [Why is Doing Code Reviews Hard?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-perform-code-reviews-in-tech-the-painless-way/#heading-why-is-doing-code-reviews-hard)

This is where AI-powered code review tools come in. The AI code review tools do not rely on human reviewers but use artificial intelligence to analyze your code and provide detailed feedback.

Let’s see the AI code review tools mentioned earlier one by one.

### **What is CodeRabbit?**

> [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/) is an AI-powered code review tool that delivers context-aware feedback on pull requests within minutes.

## **On Comparing Integration with Development Tools**

> In this section, I’ll compare how [CodeRabbit](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/overview/why-coderabbit), BitoAI, CodeAnt and Korbit AI integrate with popular development tools or platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket and Azure DevOps.

Enough talking. Let’s create four repositories in my GitHub and compare.

- [CodeRabbit](https://github.com/tyaga001/coderabbit-review-tool)
- [BitoAI](https://github.com/tyaga001/bitoai-review-tool)
- [CodeantAI](https://github.com/tyaga001/codeantai-review-tool)
- [KorbitAI](https://github.com/tyaga001/korbitai-review-tool)

Add the code below to create a `JavaScript` file named `codereview.js` in each repository.

Let's examine how different AI code review tools handle common `JavaScript` patterns.

Here's a sample `code` snippet that I'll use to compare the analysis capabilities:

```javascript
// Function to calculate the sum of an array
function calculateSum(array) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum;
}

// Function to fetch user data from an API
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/" + userId;
  let response = await fetch(url);
  let data = await response.json();
  console.log("User Data:", data);
  return data;
}

// Function to format a user's full name
function formatFullName(user) {
  return user.first_name + " " + user.last_name;
}

// Test the functions
console.log("Sum:", calculateSum([1, 2, 3, 4]));
fetchUserData(1).then((user) => {
  console.log("Formatted Name:", formatFullName(user));
});
```

The code above has common issues with performance, best practices, and maintainability that we will try to fix by making a pull request.

### **Integrating CodeRabbit with Development Tools**

> You can seamlessly integrate CodeRabbit with GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repositories to get a review for each commit in a pull request (PR) or merge request (MR).

> For example, to configure CodeRabbit using a YAML file, create a file named *.coderabbit.yaml* in the root of your repository. Then, add your configuration options to the file, as shown below. Finally, commit and push the file to your repository.

#### CodeRabbit Configuration Example

Here's a sample **CodeRabbit** configuration that showcases its customization capabilities:

```yaml
language: "en-US"
early_access: false

reviews:
  profile: "chill"
  request_changes_workflow: false
  high_level_summary: true
  poem: true
  review_status: true
  collapse_walkthrough: false
  auto_review:
    enabled: true
    drafts: false

chat:

    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Don’t forget to select which events you want to trigger the webhook.

In this case, I selected the following options:

* **Issue comments** – To enable Code Review on-demand by issuing a command in the PR comment.
* **Pull requests** – To auto-trigger Code Review when a pull request is created.
* **Pull request review comments** – You can share feedback on the review quality using emoji reactions and comments.

> Note - Once the webhook is set up, trigger the 'Code Review Agent' as follows:

1. **Issue Comments Event**: Type /***review*** in a pull request comment to prompt the agent for a review. Feedback will appear in a few minutes, depending on PR size.
2. **Pull Request Events**: The agent automatically reviews new pull requests upon creation and posts feedback as a comment.

## **On Comparing Code Quality Analysis**

> In this section, I’ll show how CodeRabbit, Bito AI Code Review Agent, CodeAnt AI, and Korbit AI evaluate code changes to identify issues or bugs and provide solutions.

To begin, create a new branch called *test\_code\_review* in each repository you created earlier.

Next, switch to the `new branch` and update the code in the `codereview.js` file using the code below and push the code changes to each repo.

```javascript
// Base API URL (parameterized for better maintainability)
const API_BASE_URL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";

// Function to calculate the sum of an array (using reduce for better readability)
function calculateSum(array) {
if (!Array.isArray(array)) {
throw new TypeError("Input must be an array of numbers.");
}
return array.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
}

// Function to fetch user data from an API with error handling
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
try {
const url = `${API_BASE_URL}/users/${userId}`;
const response = await fetch(url);
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error(`API call failed with status ${response.status}`);
}
const data = await response.json();
console.log("User Data:", data);
return data;
} catch (error) {
console.error("Error fetching user data:", error.message);
return null;
}
}

// Function to format a user's full name safely
function formatFullName(user) {
if (
!user ||
typeof user.firstName !== "string" ||
typeof user.lastName !== "string"
) {
console.warn("Invalid user object. Returning 'Unknown User'.");
return "Unknown User";
}
return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`;
}

// Function to process multiple users and calculate their total ID sum
async function processUsers(userIds) {
const results = [];
for (const userId of userIds) {
const user = await fetchUserData(userId);
if (user) {
const fullName = formatFullName(user);
console.log("Processed User:", fullName);
results.push({ id: user.id, fullName });
}
}
const totalIdSum = calculateSum(results.map((user) => user.id));
console.log("Total User ID Sum:", totalIdSum);
return results;
}

// Test the functions
(async () => {
try {
const users = await processUsers([1, 2, 3]);
console.log("Processed Users:", users);
} catch (error) {
console.error("Unexpected error during processing:", error.message);
}
})();
```

The code above fixes issues on `performance`, `best practices`, and `maintainability` in the previous code.

However, the code still has some issues. So, let us test each AI code review tool and see if they will provide the following feedback:

1. **Bug Detection:** Identify potential bugs like `asynchronous race conditions` or `invalid type checks`.

2. **Optimization Suggestions:** Recommend replacing `for loops` with more modern patterns like `Promise.all` for concurrent `API` calls.

3. **Security Warnings:** Flag `logging full user data` to the console as a potential risk in production.

4. **Performance Improvements:** Highlight the inefficiency of `sequential API` calls in `processUsers` and recommend batching them.

### **Code Quality Analysis in CodeRabbit**

After pushing the code changes to the CodeRabbit repo, click the Compare & Pull Request button if you are using GitHub as your Git provider.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_12.png"
    alt="CodeRabbit"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Next, let's create the pull request.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_13.png"
    alt="CodeRabbit"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Once you have created the pull request, wait for the **CodeRabbit** to process code changes.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_14.png"
    alt="CodeRabbit"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

After the CodeRabbit bot processes new code changes, CodeRabbit automatically generates a comprehensive `pull request summary`.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_15.png"
    alt="CodeRabbit"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Next, CodeRabbit provides a detailed `walkthrough` that breaks down the code changes introduced and organizes them by file or directory.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_16.png"
    alt="CodeRabbit"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Next, **CodeRabbit** identifies the first issue with the `API\_BASE\_URL` variable and suggests externalizing the variable for better configurability.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_17.png"
    alt="CodeRabbit"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Then, CodeRabbit identifies a `performance issue` and suggests `fetching user data concurrently` using `Promise.all` to improve `performance` when dealing with multiple users.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_18.png"
    alt="CodeRabbit"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Next, CodeRabbit identifies a bug in the `formatFullName` function and suggests fixing property access to match the `API` response structure.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_19.png"
    alt="CodeRabbit"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Finally, CodeRabbit identifies a `security issue` and suggests avoiding `logging` entire user data to prevent potential exposure of `sensitive data`.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_20.png"
    alt="CodeRabbit"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

### **Code Quality Analysis in Bito AI Code Review Agent**

After pushing the code changes to the BitoAI repository, click the Compare & Pull Request button if you are using GitHub as your Git provider.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_21.png"
    alt="Bito AI"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Then, create the pull request by clicking the Create Pull Request Button.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_22.png"
    alt="Bito AI"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Once you have created the pull request, you can initiate a code review by `typing/reviewing` it in the comment box and submitting it.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_27.png"
    alt="Bito AI"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

After Bito AI processes new code changes, it automatically generates a simple `summary of the pull request`, which is not as comprehensive as the CodeRabbit summary.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_29.png"
    alt="Bito AI"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

- Bito AI does not provide a detailed walkthrough that breaks down the code changes compared to CodeRabbit.
- Bito AI provides a changelist that displays key changes in a pull request.

After that, the Bito AI Code Review Agent identifies the first issue in the *calculateSum* function and suggests adding array element type validation.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_30.png"
    alt="Bito AI"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

- Bito AI agent identifies an issue with error logging and suggests providing more detailed error information to help with debugging.
- Bot suggests extracting sum calculation logic from the `processUsers` function to maintain the single responsibility principle.

Also, the code review agent suggests using named function over the `IIFE pattern`.

To perform an in-depth analysis of your code to identify vulnerabilities, type /***review security*** in the comment box on the pull request and submit it to initiate a code security review.

After that, Bito AI provides a code security review that suggests implementing URL validation to prevent potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_31.png"
    alt="Bito AI"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

> Unlike CodeRabbit, the code review agent does not recommend avoiding logging entire user data to prevent potential exposure to sensitive data.

> Unlike CodeRabbit, Bito AI code review agent suggests validating 'userId' before making API calls to avoid potential injection attacks.

To evaluate the code's performance by pinpointing slow or resource-intensive areas and identifying potential bottlenecks, type ***"/review performance"*** in the comment box on the pull request and submit it to initiate a code performance review.

After that, Bito AI provides a code performance review that suggests caching the API responses from '***API\_BASE\_URL***' to reduce network calls.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_32.png"
    alt="Bito AI"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Also, similar to CodeRabbit, the Bito AI code review agent suggests using `'Promise.all()' for parallel execution of user data fetching instead of sequential processing in the 'for...of' loop to improve performance.

> Note: Make sure you select the three options below only because I accidentally selected multiple extra checkboxes, which made it hard to understand the issue. Even though the config and webhook were correct, the bot didn’t trigger any code reviews. It also took longer to start the review than the other three tools.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_24.png"
    alt="CodeAnt AI"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

After that, CodeAnt AI suggests adding a check to ensure that `userId` is a valid number before making the `API` call to prevent unnecessary network requests.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_25.png"
    alt="CodeAnt AI"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

Then, similar to CodeRabbit and Bito AI Review Agent, CodeAnt AI suggests optimizing the `processUsers` function by using `Promise.all` to fetch user data concurrently, improving performance when making multiple user requests.

Finally, CodeAnt AI suggests ensuring that the `calculateSum` function handles non-numeric values in the array to prevent potential runtime errors.

> Unlike CodeRabbit and Bito AI Review Agent, CodeAnt AI does not give any security warnings in the code changes.

    height={600}
/>

After that, create the pull request by clicking the Create Pull Request Button.

After that, the Korbit AI bot processes the new code changes and automatically generates a pull request description, but there is no change walkthrough.

<Image
    src="/images/coderabbit/img_33.png"
    alt="Korbit AI"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
/>

- Korbit AI suggests adding more context to error logs in the `fetchUserData` function.
- Korbit AI suggests enhancing `console.warn` message for invalid user object.
- Korbit AI suggests adding a stack trace to error logs.

Then, similar to CodeRabbit, Bito AI Code Review Agent, and CodeAnt AI, Korbit AI suggests optimizing the `processUsers` function with `Promise.all()` to improve performance.

Finally, Korbit AI suggests enhancing log messages.

Like CodeAnt AI, Korbit AI does not issue security warnings about code changes.

Click [here](https://github.com/tyaga001/korbitai-review-tool/pull/1) to view the complete Pull Request code review using Korbit AI.

## **On Comparing Actionable Code Suggestions**

## **On Comparing Security and Privacy**

> In this section, we will compare the security and privacy of CodeRabbit, Bito AI, CodeAnt AI, and Korbit AI.

> Before we begin, note that a good AI code review tool should prevent AI model data leakage and not use data collected from code reviews to train their AI models.

Also, the code reviewer should have `zero persistent code storage`, `end-to-end encryption`, `code deletion after analysis`, and `compliance with global data regulations.

### **Security and Privacy in CodeRabbit**

> On Data Privacy and Security, CodeRabbit does not use data collected from code reviews to train or influence its models. All queries to large language models (LLMs) are temporary, with zero retention, and no data is shared with third parties.

- Code is temporarily stored in memory during the review process and deleted afterwards. While the code isn’t stored, CodeRabbit stores `embeddings` based on chat conversations and workflow systems **(Linear, Jira, GitHub/GitLab issues)** to improve future reviews.

- In [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/dpa), all data is kept confidential, isolated by the organization, and complies with `SOC2 Type II` and `GDPR` standards.

Read an official statement on the Data Protection Addendum [here](https://www.coderabbit.ai/dpa).

### **Security and Privacy in Bito AI**

> On Data Privacy and Security, BitoAI allows you to decide where to store your code: locally on your machine, in your cloud, or on Bito’s cloud.

- Bito AI does not store any code, `code` snippets, `indexes` or `embedding vectors` on Bito’s servers unless you expressly allow that. Importantly, their AI partners do not store any of this information. All requests are transmitted over `HTTPS` and are fully encrypted.

- In Bito AI, your code or AI requests are not used for `AI model` training. Also, your code or AI requests are not stored by their AI partners.

- In Bito AI, all data is kept confidential, isolated by the organization, and complies with `SOC2 Type II` standards.

### **Security and Privacy in CodeAnt AI**

> On Data Privacy and Security, CodeAnt AI has not specified whether it uses data collected from code reviews to train or influence its AI models.

Also, CodeAnt AI has not specified whether it stores your code on its servers during and after the code review process.

However, CodeAnt AI complies with `SOC2 Type II`, `HIPAA`, `MISRA` and `GDPR` data compliance standards.

### **Security and Privacy in Korbit AI**

> On Data Privacy and Security, Korbit AI protects all data transmitted to the AI models with TLS encryption.

Your code remains confidential at Korbit AI and is never used to train AI models. Korbit AI has `zero-day retention policy` contracts with `OpenAI` and `Anthropic` to ensure your data is safe and secure.

With Korbit AI, all the code used in the review process is deleted to ensure your intellectual property remains safe and secure.

However, Korbit AI collects message data (excluding your code) to enhance the quality of their responses.

> Korbit AI compliance with global data regulations is not specified.
