## **Introduction**

In modern web development, users expect interfaces to feel smooth and polished, with transitions that enhance the overall experience. However, achieving seamless animations often requires writing complex CSS, managing JavaScript-based transitions, and handling performance issues, which can be both time-consuming and challenging.

The **View Transitions API** simplifies this process by providing a native browser-based solution for smooth animations during DOM updates. Instead of relying on external libraries or custom animations, this API offers a declarative approach to handling transitions, ensuring better performance and maintainability.

So let’s explore what it is, and how to use it, I also include how to effortlessly implement it in your Next.js Apps.

## **What is the View Transitions API?**

The View Transitions API is a built-in animation engine for your UI updates. Whether you're swapping out content, handling page transitions, or animating a modal, it makes things look fluid **automatically**.

Here’s why it’s different from what you’ve been doing so far:

- **No manual keyframes** – The browser does the heavy lifting for you.
- **Native optimization** – Unlike janky JS-based animations, this runs **smoothly** at the browser level.
- **Simpler syntax** – A single function (`document.startViewTransition()`) wraps your updates and makes them transition seamlessly.

---

## **Key Features of the View Transitions API**

- **Built-in Animations:** Handles DOM updates and navigation transitions out of the box.
- **Zero external dependencies:** No need for GSAP, Framer Motion, or custom CSS/JS hacks.
- **Customizable:** Want more control? You can define your own animations.
- **Browser Optimized:** Uses GPU acceleration and frame timing to ensure smooth transitions.
- **Works for SPAs & MPAs:** Whether you're working with React, Next.js, or a classic multi-page app, you can use it anywhere.

---

### **Where Should You Use It?**

- **SPA Route Changes** – Instead of abrupt page swaps, you get fluid transitions that enhance user experience. Navigating between pages no longer feels jarring but instead flows naturally, making single-page applications feel more polished.
- **Dynamic Content Updates** – Elements like lists, modals, popovers, and image previews benefit greatly from smooth animations. Instead of content snapping into place, the transitions ensure a visual connection between old and new states.
- **Multi-Page Transitions** – If you're still working with a traditional multi-page application, this API makes navigating between full document reloads feel more modern and interactive.
- **UI Interactions** – Expanding cards, switching tabs, toggling views—anything that dynamically modifies the DOM can be enhanced with seamless animations, improving engagement and usability.

---

## **How to Use the View Transitions API**

### **1. The Basics – One Function to Rule Them All**

The core method is `document.startViewTransition()`. It takes a function that updates the DOM and wraps it in an animation.

```jsx
if (document.startViewTransition) {
  document.startViewTransition(() => {
    document.getElementById("content").textContent = "New Content!"
  })
} else {
  document.getElementById("content").textContent = "New Content!"
}
```

### **2. Customizing Transitions with CSS**

Wanna tweak the animations? The API exposes pseudo-elements for the old and new states. You can style them like this:

```css
::view-transition-old(root) {
  animation: fadeOut 0.3s ease-out;
}

::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease-in;
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

### **3. Animating Page Navigation**

Need smooth page transitions? Wrap your navigation logic inside `startViewTransition()`.

```jsx
const links = document.querySelectorAll("a")
links.forEach((link) => {
  link.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    document.startViewTransition(() => {
      window.location.href = link.href
    })
  })
})
```

## Limitations of View Transition API

- **Limited Browser Support** - Currently, the **View Transition API** is only available in **Chromium-based browsers** like **Chrome and Edge**. It’s not supported in **Firefox** or **Safari** yet.
- **Works Best with Declarative DOM Updates** - The API captures the "before" and "after" states of elements, but it requires **DOM updates to happen synchronously** within a single animation frame. If you’re using **asynchronous updates** (like fetching data before updating the UI), transitions might not work as expected.
- **Limited Support for Complex Animations** - The API is **great for crossfade and slide transitions**, but it **does not support complex GSAP-style animations** (e.g., morphing, staggered animations, or physics-based transitions).
- Does not support Spring Animations - The API primarily uses **CSS-based animations** and interpolates element properties (like position, opacity, and scale) over a **fixed duration**. It lacks built-in support for **spring physics**, which require dynamic easing and velocity-based motion.

---

## **Why Should You Bother with View Transitions API?**

- **Saves time** – Writing animations manually is tedious. This makes it effortless.
- **Better performance** – Browser-optimized animations reduce jank and improve UX.
- **Cleaner code** – Reduces the need for third-party libraries and custom scripts.
- **Framework-friendly** – Works seamlessly with React, Next.js, Vue, or plain JavaScript.
- **Future-proof** – As browser support grows, this API will likely become the standard for UI transitions.

## **View Transitions API with Next.js**

Fortunately there’s a npm package that integrates with Next.js directly and makes using View Transitions API very easy. Here’s the steps to getting it integrated into your existing Next.js App.

### **1. Installing the Dependency**

For Next.js, install `next-view-transitions` through npm:

```bash
npm install next-view-transitions
```

### **2. Setting Up a Layout Wrapper**

To use the package, you need to wrap your Entire Layout with a `<ViewTransitions>` provider that comes with the package.

In `layout.tsx`, wrap your pages with the transition provider:

```tsx
import { ViewTransitions } from "next-view-transitions"

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return <ViewTransitions>{children}</ViewTransitions>
}
```

### **3. Replacing `next/link` with View Transitions**

Now to use the page transitions replace your `<Link>` from `next/link` with `<Link>` from `next-view-transitions`

```tsx
import { Link } from "next-view-transitions"

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <Link href="/about">Go to About</Link>
}
```

And that’s it, now as you navigate between the pages you should be able to see smooth transition. You can take look at there example [here](https://nirnejak.com/)

### **Final Thoughts**

The View Transitions API is still **new**, but it’s already showing massive potential. That makes it the perfect time to learn and get started with it. If you’re building modern web apps, it’s definitely worth experimenting with.
