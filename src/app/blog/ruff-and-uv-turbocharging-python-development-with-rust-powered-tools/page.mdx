## Introduction

Python’s a powerhouse, but let’s be honest, managing code quality and dependencies can feel like herding cats. Linting, formatting, and package management often involve juggling multiple tools, each with its own quirks. Enter Ruff and uv: two Rust-powered tools that streamline these tasks with blazing speed and simplicity. This post dives deep into how they work, why they’re game-changers, and how to use them effectively in your Python projects.

- **Why Ruff and uv?** They’re fast, unified, and built in Rust for performance.
- **What’s the goal?** Show you how to integrate these tools into your workflow with practical, code-heavy examples.

## What is Ruff?

Ruff is a Python linter and formatter written in Rust, designed to replace a slew of tools like Flake8, Pylint, isort, and Black. It’s not just fast, it’s blazingly fast, often 10-100x quicker than its Python-based counterparts. Ruff combines linting and formatting into a single tool, supports auto-fixing issues, and offers over 700 configurable rules. Whether you’re catching syntax errors, enforcing style guidelines, or tidying up imports, Ruff does it all in one pass, making it a powerhouse for maintaining code quality.

**Key Features**:

- Combines linting and formatting, reducing tool sprawl.
- Supports over 700 rules, including compatibility with Flake8 plugins.
- Auto-fixes issues like unused imports, missing commas, or incorrect syntax.
- Integrates seamlessly with IDEs like VS Code, PyCharm, and CI pipelines.

**Benefits**:

- Simplifies setup by replacing multiple tools with one.
- Scales effortlessly for large codebases (100k+ lines of code).
- Requires minimal configuration to get started.

### **Why is Ruff So Fast?**

Ruff’s speed comes from Rust, a compiled language that produces highly optimized machine code. Unlike Python, which is interpreted and slowed by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), Rust supports multithreading, allowing Ruff to parallelize tasks across CPU cores. For example, linting thousands of files can be split into concurrent jobs, slashing processing time. Additionally, Rust’s memory safety eliminates the overhead of Python’s garbage collection, ensuring Ruff runs lean and mean.

### **Example of Linting and Formatting with Ruff**

Install Ruff globally to enable system-wide usage (we will cover installing Ruff for a specific project using uv later in this guide)

```bash
pip install ruff # we will later install ruff with uv
```

Imagine you’ve got a sloppy Python script, [sample.py](http://sample.py/), with some common issues:

```python
# sample.py
def greet(name):
    print(f"hello {name}") # Missing comma, unformatted
    unused_var = 42
    return None
```

**To catch these problems, run Ruff’s linter:**

```bash
ruff check sample.py
```

**Output:**

```text
sample.py:2:5: E703 Missing comma in f-string
sample.py:3:5: F841 Local variable `unused_var` is assigned to but never used
Found 2 errors (1 fixable).
```

**Ruff pinpoints the missing comma and unused variable. To fix the fixable issue automatically:**

```bash
ruff check sample.py --fix
```

**Then, format the code to adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines:**

```bash
ruff format sample.py
```

**The updated `sample.py` looks clean:**

```bash
def greet(name):
    print(f"hello, {name}")
    return None
```

This process is lightning-fast because Ruff’s Rust backend processes the abstract syntax tree (AST) in parallel, unlike Flake8 or Pylint, which are constrained by Python’s single-threaded execution.

## What is uv?

uv is a Rust-based Python package and project manager that replaces tools like pip, virtualenv, Poetry, and pipenv. Built by Astral (the same team behind Ruff), uv prioritizes speed and simplicity. It handles everything from creating projects to resolving dependencies and running scripts, all while being orders of magnitude faster than Python-based alternatives. Its tool runner (uv tool run) and lockfile support make it a one-stop shop for Python project management.

**Key Features**:

- Resolves dependencies in milliseconds using a SAT solver.
- Automatically manages virtual environments, no manual activation needed.
- Runs external tools (like Ruff) via uv tool run.
- Generates lockfiles for reproducible builds.

**Benefits**:

- Speeds up project setup and dependency installation.
- Handles complex dependency graphs with ease.
- Integrates tightly with Ruff for a unified workflow.

### **Why is uv Soooo Fast?**

Like Ruff, uv benefits from Rust’s compiled nature and multithreading capabilities. Dependency resolution, a notorious bottleneck in tools like pip or Poetry, is handled by a SAT solver that runs in parallel, evaluating package constraints efficiently. Python-based tools, hampered by the GIL, process dependencies sequentially, leading to slowdowns on large projects. uv also caches packages globally, so reinstalls are nearly instantaneous, unlike pip’s repetitive downloads.

### **Example of Setting Up a Project with uv:**

**Let’s create a new project from scratch:**

```bash
uv init my-project
cd my-project
```

**Add some dependencies, like `requests` and `pandas`:**

```bash
uv add requests pandas
```

**This creates a virtual environment and updates `pyproject.toml`:**

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.28.0",
    "pandas>=2.0.0",
]
```

To run a script, say `main.py` , without activating the virtual environment:

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

uv’s dependency resolution takes milliseconds, even for projects with dozens of packages. Compare that to pip, which can take seconds, or Poetry, which might crawl on complex dependency trees. The global cache means subsequent installs are virtually free, saving you time on CI or local setups.

## Why Rust for Python Tools?

Rust is the backbone of Ruff and uv’s performance. Here’s why it outshines Python for these tools:

- **Compiled vs. Interpreted**: Rust compiles to machine code, executing directly on the CPU. Python, being interpreted, incurs overhead as the interpreter translates code at runtime.
- **Multithreading**: Rust’s ownership model enables safe, concurrent execution across multiple threads. Python’s GIL forces single-threaded execution, bottlenecking tools like Flake8 or pip.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Rust’s zero-cost abstractions and lack of garbage collection minimize memory overhead, unlike Python’s dynamic memory management.
- **Parallel Processing**: Both Ruff and uv leverage Rust’s parallelism to process files or resolve dependencies concurrently, scaling with CPU cores.

The Python community is rallying around these tools. X posts and tech blogs highlight their adoption in projects like Django, FastAPI, and even internal tools at companies like Microsoft. Developers love the speed and simplicity, and the Rust-Python synergy is proving to be a winning formula.

</table>

- **Ruff**: Replaces multiple tools, runs faster, and scales better. Flake8 and Pylint struggle with large codebases due to Python’s GIL, while Black is limited to formatting.
- **uv**: Outpaces pip, Poetry, and pipenv in dependency resolution and project setup. pipenv’s slow resolution and cumbersome CLI make it less appealing for modern workflows.
- **Integration**: Ruff and uv shine in IDEs and CI/CD, with uv’s tool runner bridging the gap between project management and linting.

pipenv, while popular for its lockfile support, suffers from slow dependency resolution and a heavy virtualenv setup. Its Python-based resolver can’t match uv’s Rust-powered SAT solver, and its CLI feels clunky compared to uv’s streamlined commands.

## Practical Example: Using Ruff and uv Together

Let’s walk through building a small API client to fetch data from a REST endpoint. This example shows how Ruff and uv streamline real-world development.

**Step 1: Set Up the Project**

```bash
uv init api-client
cd api-client
uv add requests httpx
```

This sets up a virtual environment and adds `requests` and `httpx` to `pyproject.toml`.

```toml
[project]
name = "api-client"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.28.0",
    "httpx>=0.23.0",
]
```

uv’s SAT solver resolves these dependencies in milliseconds, and the global cache ensures future installs are even faster.

**Step 2: Write the Code**

Create `main.py` :

```python
import requests
import httpx

def fetch_data(url):
    response = requests.get(url)  # Unhandled exception
    data = response.json()
    print(data)

def main():
    fetch_data("https://fake-json-api.mock.beeceptor.com/companies")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code fetches JSON data but lacks error handling and uses a vague variable name.

**Step 3: Lint with Ruff**

Run Ruff to catch issues:

```bash
ruff check main.py
```

**Output:**

```text
main.py:5:5: E741 Unhandled exception: `requests.RequestException`
main.py:6:5: E741 Ambiguous variable name: `data`
Found 2 errors (1 fixable).
```

**Fix the exception handling:**

```bash
ruff check main.py --fix
```

**Updated `main.py`:**

```python
import requests
import httpx

def fetch_data(url):
	try:
		response = requests.get(url)
		result = response.json()
		print(result)
	except requests.RequestException as e:
		print(f"Error: {e}")

def main():
	fetch_data("https://fake-json-api.mock.beeceptor.com/companies")

if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```

Ruff’s Rust backend makes this process near-instant, catching errors and formatting code in one pass.

**Format the code:**

```bash
ruff format main.py
```

**Step 4: Run with uv**

Execute the script:

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

uv handles the virtual environment and dependencies transparently, so you can focus on coding.

**To try httpx instead, update `main.py` :**

```python
import httpx

def fetch_data(url):
	try:
		response = httpx.get(url)
		result = response.json()
		print(result)
	except httpx.RequestException as e:
		print(f"Error: {e}")

def main():
	fetch_data("https://fake-json-api.mock.beeceptor.com/companies")

if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```

This workflow - setting up, coding, linting and formatting is smooth and fast. uv manages dependencies and scripts, while Ruff ensures code quality, all with minimal overhead.

## Integrations

Both Ruff offers Visual Studio Code extensions that help you identify issues in your code in real time and allow you to use Ruff as a formatter instead of VSCode's default formatter.

You can install Ruff extension and add to `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.ruffEnabled": true,
  "python.formatting.provider": "ruff"
}
```

For GitHub Actions, add a workflow:

```yaml
name: Lint and Format
on: [push]
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install uv
        run: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
      - name: Install Ruff
        run: uv tool install ruff
      - name: Lint
        run: uv tool run ruff check .
      - name: Format
        run: uv tool run ruff format --check .
```

## Advanced Usage:

### **Configuring Ruff**

Create a `ruff.toml` for custom rules:

```toml
[lint]
select = ["E", "F", "B", "I"]  # Enable specific rule categories
ignore = ["E501"]  # Ignore line length warnings
fixable = ["ALL"]  # Auto-fix all fixable issues
```

Run Ruff with the config:

```bash
ruff check . --config ruff.toml
```

### **Using uv’s Tool Runner**

Run Ruff via uv:

```bash
uv tool run ruff check .
```

This ensures Ruff uses the project’s virtual environment, avoiding version conflicts.

### **Lockfiles with uv**

Generate a uv.lock for reproducible builds:

```bash
uv lock
```

The lockfile pins exact dependency versions, ensuring consistency across environments, from local development to CI pipelines.
