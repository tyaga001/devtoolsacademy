### What Happens When AI Code Reviewers Disagree with Human Reviewers?

In software development, AI code reviewers have become indispensable.

<Image src={image1} alt="code review" width={1200} height={600} />

> Tools like [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/), GitHub [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), and [SonarQube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SonarQube) scan code for errors, security flaws, and style violations at speeds no human can match. Yet their rise has sparked a quiet dilemma.

*What happens when developers disagree with the suggestions made by AI Code Review tools?*

Disagreements between AI and human reviewers go beyond simple technical disputes. They expose a deeper struggle between the precision of these AI powered code review solutions and their ability to decipher the grey areas of human intent and context.

> *For example, if I ignore AI's warning about some code in my changes, I risk allowing a hidden vulnerability to enter our production code.*

On the other hand, if I dismiss my expertise and blindly accept all AI recommendations, I could add huge technical debt that stifles creativity, conflicts with my team, and potentially slow down my team.
<Image src={image2} alt="code review" width={1200} height={600} />

As generative AI code review tools become more embedded in our coding process, one question feels more important to all the teams.
<Image src={image3} alt="code review" width={1200} height={600} />
How do we reconcile the cold logic of AI powered tools with the wisdom of human experience, and who ultimately decides what "**better code**" looks like?

In this article, let’s discuss the tensions, consequences, and future of AI code review tools and human disagreements in code reviews.

## What are AI code reviews?

> AI [code reviews](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-perform-code-reviews-in-tech-the-painless-way/) examine code for errors, security problems, performance concerns, and adherence to industry best practices. Unlike traditional static analysis tools, generative AI code review tools have improved functionality by integrating ML models, rule based techniques, and LLMs.

AI code review tools stand out for their ability to scan through thousands of lines of code and ***detect speed*** and ***patterns***, ***security flaws***, and ***bugs*** with precision that human reviewers cannot match.

## How AI Code Review Tools Work.

> AI code review tools use several techniques, including ***static analysis***, ***dynamic analysis***, ***natural language processing***, and ***rule-based systems***.

### 1\. Static code analysis

> Static code analysis is like a spellchecker for programming languages. These tools scan for syntax errors, deviations from coding standards (e.g., inconsistent indentation), and security vulnerabilities such as exposed API keys or SQL injection risks.

### 2\. Dynamic code analysis

> Dynamic code analysis tests code while running, simulating real world conditions to uncover hidden flaws. It identifies runtime errors (e.g., memory leaks), performance bottlenecks (slow database queries), and security vulnerabilities that only manifest during execution.

### 3\. NLP & LLMs

> NLP and LLMs like GPT-4, [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) represent the frontier of AI code review. These models are trained on vast code datasets and understand context, logic, and intent. They don't just flag issues; they explain them in plain language and suggest fixes.

***For example, a tool like GitHub Copilot has shown an impressive ability to review code in Java, Python, Rust, etc., offering suggestions specific to each language syntax.***

### 4\. Rule based systems.

> Rule based systems enforce coding standards and best practices through predefined guidelines. They act as automated policy enforcers, ensuring compliance with organizational rules (e.g., "*Always encrypt user data*") or industry regulations (e.g., ***HIPAA, GDPR***).

**Why AI Code Review is a Game Changer**

1. **Blazing fast:** AI can review code in the blink of an eye, speeding up the development process.
2. **Handles the heavy lifting:** Got a massive codebase? No problem. AI can go through it without breaking a sweat, which would be a huge task for humans.
3. **Consistent as clockwork:** Unlike us, AI applies the same rules every single time—no more inconsistencies or things slipping through the cracks.
4. **Education**: LLMs explain issues in detail, helping junior developers learn best practices.
5. **Risk mitigation**: Catches security flaws early, preventing breaches and technical debt.

## When Do AI and Human Reviewers Disagree?

AI code reviews are powerful allies, but they're not all knowing.

> As developers, we often possess something machines lack ‘***context’***. While AI excels at pattern recognition and rule enforcement, it can't grasp the nuances of business deadlines, legacy systems, or the creative compromises required to ship software in the real world.

## Let’s Compare Both Approaches

AI brings speed, consistency, and scalability, while humans offer intuition, domain expertise, and contextual awareness. Striking the right balance between the two leads to better code quality and more efficient reviews.

## CodeRabbit AI Code review at Work

Let’s see how CodeRabbit does code reviews on a GitHub repo.

<Image src={image4} alt="code review" width={1200} height={600} />

Once a pull request is created, CodeRabbit will automatically analyze the new code changes and generate a summary highlighting key improvements and potential issues in the codebase.

1. It detects a performance bottleneck in the **processUsers** function. It suggests fetching user data concurrently using **Promise.all** to optimize execution when dealing with multiple users.
2. It recommends implementing batch processing to process large arrays in chunks to enhance efficiency further. The suggestion includes defining a batch size and executing API calls in parallel to prevent performance degradation.
3. It identifies test data embedded in the main file and suggests moving it to a separate test file for better maintainability.

CodeRabbit also flags the **fetchUserData** function, highlighting areas for improvement:

* Adding a request timeout to avoid long running API calls.
* Replacing console logs with meaningful success messages while avoiding logging full user data.
* Throwing errors instead of returning null to prevent silent failures.
* Finally, It identifies a **security issue** in logging practices, advising against logging full user data.

<Image src={image5} alt="code review" width={1200} height={600} />

While CodeRabbit offers valuable suggestions, I’ve noticed that AI driven reviews don’t always align with my thought process.

Human reviewers bring experience, domain knowledge, and contextual awareness factors AI often lacks.

> AI Code review tools may enforce best practices, but they don’t always account for real world constraints like legacy systems, performance trade offs, or project timelines.

Now, let’s explore 8 real world cases where AI recommendations and human judgment took different paths.

## 1\. Lack of Context in Code Impact and Usage.

> AI code review tools operate on static analysis, meaning they analyze code without running it or understanding its context within the application. While AI excels at identifying potential inefficiencies, it lacks the ability to determine their real world impact.

This can lead to misguided optimization suggestions. For example, AI may flag a piece of code as "***inefficient***" without knowing whether it affects system performance meaningfully.

> AI treats all inefficiencies equally, assuming that every optimization is beneficial when, in reality, not all inefficiencies need fixing. Some code sections are performance critical and require deep optimization, while others are rarely executed and do not need additional complexity.

This is where human judgment comes in. I don't just look at inefficiencies; I consider how often the code runs and whether an optimization will actually improve performance. Sometimes, it's better to leave things as they are, even if AI disagrees.

> An AI code review tool might flag a slow SQL query in an admin panel used only a few times per week as a performance concern, even though its impact on the overall system is negligible.

## 2\. Contextual Understanding in Legacy Systems

I remember working with legacy systems during my Barclays days in India, which imposed strict data ***processing***, ***storage***, and ***transmission requirements***.

These systems often rely on old tech and configs that may no longer be considered best practices today.

Let's say you're working on a system that interacts with an old database or external API that only supports Latin-1 encoding. Since utf-8 is now the standard, most modern apps default to it. However, switching to utf-8 would cause data corruption or break compatibility with the legacy system.

This function illustrates how you might handle such a situation:

```python
def process_data(data):
    encoded_data = data.encode('latin-1')
    return encoded_data
```

Code review tools are designed to enforce modern best practices, which means they will likely flag the use of **Latin-1** and recommend switching to **utf-8** for broader compatibility.

<Image src={image6} alt="code review" width={1200} height={600} />

While this is technically correct in most cases, AI does not understand that the system being worked on requires latin-1 and cannot be upgraded to UTF-8.

## 3\. Handling Temporary Workarounds for Critical Bug Fixes.

Ideally, every bug fix would be well architected, thoroughly tested, and future proof. But ***production fires don't wait for perfect fixes in the real world***.

Sometimes, when a critical failure occurs, speed is the priority, and devs must act fast to restore functionality, even if that means implementing a temporary, imperfect workaround. I’ve done this so many times and later refactored it.

> ***Your app is handling thousands of active users, and suddenly, an external service dependency starts failing intermittently.***

> An external service you depend on starts acting up. Maybe the API's timing out, the database is throwing errors, or your authentication provider's gone dark. Whatever it is, your users are suddenly hitting broken features or crashing the app outright. Frustration levels are rising, revenue's taking a hit, and you are potentially violating SLA agreements.

Your team jumps into action, trying to figure out what's gone wrong. But finding the real fix will take some serious digging.

> Let's say your app relies on an external API to fetch data, but the service is experiencing intermittent failures. Instead of letting the application crash, you implement a temporary workaround that catches the error and returns a fallback response.

```python
import requests
import logging
import time

# Enable logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
EXTERNAL_API_URL = "https://api.example.com/data"

def fetch_data():
    """
    Fetches data from an external API. Implements a temporary workaround
    to handle intermittent failures.

    Returns:
        dict: The API response or a fallback response in case of failure.
    """
    try:
        response = requests.get(EXTERNAL_API_URL, timeout=3)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Temporary Workaround: API request failed - {e}")
        return {"status": "error", "message": "Data unavailable, using fallback."}

# Simulating multiple requests
if __name__ == "__main__":
    for _ in range(3):
        data = fetch_data()
        print(data)
        time.sleep(2)
```

In the example above, where the function catches API failures and returns a fallback response, AI may ***flag*** the implementation as insufficient due to the lack of proper error handling mechanisms.

From an AI perspective, proper error handling would go beyond logging the error and returning a generic fallback message.

**AI Code Review tools might suggest:**

* Implementing a retry mechanism instead of immediately returning an error response.
* Using structured exception handling to differentiate between transient failures (e.g., timeouts) and permanent errors (e.g., 404 Not Found).
* Providing more detailed feedback rather than a generic "Data unavailable" message. etc.

<Image src={image7} alt="code review" width={1200} height={600} />

Although these recommendations are accurate from a best practices perspective, they do not always reflect real world examples. In the face of an urgent production failure, devs usually fix the functionality rather than make it mirror perfect.

## 4\. Overengineering for Simple Tasks

We often write quick scripts to solve immediate problems, whether cleaning up a dataset for a one time analysis, transforming a file format, or automating a simple task.
In these cases, simplicity and speed matter more than long term maintainability.

> ***A short script that does the job efficiently is preferable to an over engineered solution. If the script isn't meant to be part of a larger system or reused frequently, adding unnecessary complexity only slows things down.***

Here's an example of a quick, one off script that cleans a CSV file containing customer survey responses.

Some columns in the dataset have missing values, and we need to remove incomplete rows and save a clean version for analysis. There's no need for elaborate error handling or configurability—just read, clean, and save.

```python
import pandas as pd

def clean_survey_data(file):
    """
    Load a CSV file, drop rows with missing values,
    and save the cleaned data.
    """
    data = pd.read_csv(file)            # Load the dataset
    data.dropna(inplace=True)           # Remove incomplete responses
    data.to_csv("cleaned_survey.csv", index=False)

# Usage
clean_survey_data("raw_survey_data.csv")
```

This script solves the problem in just a few lines.

- It's clear, easy to run, and does exactly what's needed, nothing more, nothing less.
- As it is not intended for use in production pipelines, further layers of validation, logging, or configuration would make matters more complex than they need to be.

But AI powered tools don’t always distinguish between a simple one off script and a scalable, reusable system. They generally enforce best practices for everything adopted, whether it leads to over engineering or not.

In this case, the AI suggests refactoring the script to make it more robust by adding input validation, configurable output paths, structured error handling, and logging.

<Image src={image8} alt="code review" width={1200} height={600} />

While these improvements might be helpful in a **long term project**, they are unnecessary for a dev who just wants a **quick solution** to clean a dataset and move on.

## 5\. Navigating Novel and Domain Specific Challenges

In some projects, especially in research driven fields like machine learning, scientific computing, or high performance computing, developers often have to step outside standard implementations to create solutions tailored to highly specific problems.

> AI powered code review tools, however, tend to favor well established best practices over unconventional but necessary customizations. This can create friction when working on novel challenges where deviating from common patterns is justified and required.

***Here's an example**: you're building a machine learning model for diagnosing rare diseases using a dataset with highly imbalanced classes, where positive cases (disease detected) are far fewer than negative cases (no disease).*

A standard loss function like ***Mean Squared Error (MSE)*** or ***Cross Entropy Loss*** would treat all samples equally, leading to poor learning performance for the rare class.

To address this, you implement a custom weighted loss function that assigns higher importance to rare positive cases.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Custom loss function to handle class imbalance in rare disease classification.

    Positive cases (y_true = 1) are given higher weight to improve sensitivity.
    """
    weights = tf.where(y_true == 1, 25.0, 1.0)  # Give rare cases more importance
    return tf.reduce_mean(weights * (y_true - y_pred)**2)  # Weighted MSE loss

# Example usage in a model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This function solves a real world problem that standard loss functions struggle with. Medical AI models must prioritize recall (catching positive cases) over simple accuracy, which this function helps achieve.

However, AI code reviewers might flag this as non standard and suggest using a built in loss function like **BinaryCrossentropy()**, arguing that sticking to standard implementations improves reliability and maintainability.

<Image src={image9} alt="code review" width={1200} height={600} />


As a developer who understands their data, you must trust your expertise over generic AI recommendations.

## 6\. Performance Optimization vs. Readability

> In low level programming and high performance computing, optimizing execution speed is often more important than keeping the code highly readable.

Unlike higher level languages like ***Python*** or ***JavaScript***, ***C*** developers prioritize efficiency, especially when working with large datasets, real time systems, or embedded applications.

One effective optimization technique is loop unrolling, which reduces the number of iterations and minimizes CPU overhead caused by loop control operations.

While AI powered tools may flag this technique as unnecessary complexity, the trade off between readability and efficiency is intentional in performance critical code.

***Here's an example of a function that processes a dataset using loop unrolling, which handles four elements per iteration instead of one, reducing the number of loop control operations and improving.***

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define DATA_SIZE 1000  // Example dataset size

void process(int value) {
    // Simulated computation
    printf("Processing value: %d\n", value);
}

void process_data(int *data, int n) {
    // Optimized loop using loop unrolling
    int i = 0;
    for (; i + 3 < n; i += 4) {
        process(data[i]);
        process(data[i + 1]);
        process(data[i + 2]);
        process(data[i + 3]);
    }
    // Handle any remaining elements
    for (; i < n; i++) {
        process(data[i]);
    }
}

int main() {
    int data[DATA_SIZE];
    // Initialize data
    for (int i = 0; i < DATA_SIZE; i++) {
        data[i] = i;
    }
    // Process the dataset
    process_data(data, DATA_SIZE);
    return 0;
}
```

AI powered code reviewers may flag this and suggest replacing it with a **standard loop** for better readability and maintainability:

```c
void process_data(int *data, int n) {
// AI-suggested code: More readable but potentially slower
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
process(data[i]);
}
}
```
This version is cleaner and easier to read. However, it increases the number of iterations, introducing more CPU overhead in performance critical applications.

#### **Why This AI Suggestion Falls Short**

Unrolling the loop means your code runs faster, particularly with large datasets, because it reduces the number of loop iterations. And sure, in systems where every millisecond counts, like real time applications, performance trumps readability.

## 7\. Ignoring Domain Specific Conventions.

> Accuracy is critical in financial apps. Whether you're calculating account balances, processing transactions, or handling taxes, even the smallest rounding error can accumulate into significant discrepancies over time.

The problem is that floating point arithmetic, which is often used for general numerical calculations in programming, is inherently imprecise because of how floating point numbers are stored in memory.

However, accuracy is non negotiable in finance, and devs must use decimal based arithmetic to ensure exact calculations.

On the other hand, our AI code review tool suggests using floating point arithmetic, which is faster.

```python
def calculate_total(prices):
    return sum(prices)
```

However, using the AI suggested approach could cause precision errors when dealing with fractional amounts.

Financial applications use **Python's** **Decimal class to ensure precision**, which provides exact arithmetic for monetary values.

```python
from decimal import Decimal
def calculate_total(prices):
"""
Accurately sums monetary values using Decimal to prevent floating-point errors.
"""
total = Decimal('0.00')  # Start with an exact decimal representation
    for price in prices:
total += Decimal(price)  # Convert each price to Decimal before summing
    return total
```

### **Why the AI's suggestion misses the point**

Floating point numbers can't perfectly represent every decimal value, so rounding problems can occur, especially in financial calculations.

For instance, adding 0.1 and 0.2 doesn't always give you exactly 0.3.

```python
print(0.1 + 0.2)  # Output: 0.30000000000000004
```

While a tiny difference like that might seem unimportant, those little errors can add up and cause big problems when dealing with millions of transactions in a financial system.

Regulations in the banking and financial industries mandate precise decimal calculations to ensure transactional accuracy.

## 8\. Overlooking Platform Specific requirements.

When developing apps for resource constrained environments like embedded systems, IoT devices, or legacy hardware, developers must carefully manage memory, CPU usage, and file I/O operations.

Unlike traditional desktop or server environments, embedded systems have strict constraints; a trivial file operation on a high performance machine may consume too much RAM or block execution in an embedded system.

> AI code review tools prioritize best practices from general purpose computing, where standard libraries for file handling work efficiently without concern for hardware limitations. Given this, the AI is likely to suggest a more straightforward, more readable approach, using Python's built in **open()** function to read the entire file into memory at once:

```python
def read_config(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return file.read()
```

This approach usually works well on most of today's systems since RAM and processing power aren't typically a problem. The AI prioritizes readability and simplicity, which makes the code easier to maintain and keeps the line count down.

**Where Things Get Tricky**

The AI's suggestion doesn't consider the limitations of specific platforms.

AI powered reviews learn from common programming patterns, which means they might miss optimizations specific to a particular platform.

```python
def read_config(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
# Custom buffered reading to manage memory usage
config_data = []
            while chunk := file.read(64):  # Read in small chunks
config_data.append(chunk)
            return ''.join(config_data)
    except OSError:
        return "Error reading file"
```

For example, the buffered reading approach is much more scalable, which is important because our system will need to handle larger files in the future.

## Maximizing the Benefits of AI Code Reviews

We've looked at some situations where AI code review tools and human reviewers might disagree, but that doesn't mean these tools aren't helpful or practical.

AI code review tools are not a static field. These tools learn more and accumulate data from the day to day use of the tools, recording this data and providing feedback based on daily updates.

> ***AI is not meant to replace human reviewers; it's to help speed up development, find better code quality, and save time.***

<Image src={image10} alt="code review" width={1200} height={600} />

Many code review tools now support custom rule configurations so dev teams can calibrate AI review standards to their particular workflows.

<Image src={image11} alt="code review" width={1200} height={600} />

Over time, these tools will better understand ***project specific contexts***, leading to fewer ***false positives*** and more relevant suggestions.

Additionally, developers can train AI reviewers by providing context, adjusting rule settings, and overriding incorrect suggestions.

We've seen how AI powered code review tools can make the code review process much faster and more consistent. But the real magic happens when you combine the speed and accuracy of these tools with the intuition and deep domain expertise of development teams. That's when code review shines.

Many of the challenges we've discussed can be overcome with better training data, improved models, careful fine tuning, good feedback loops, and a watchful eye from experienced developers.

## Conclusion.

So, while we've seen some cases where AI code review tools and human developers might not ideally agree, it's clear that bringing AI into the code review process offers many benefits.

Tools like [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/blog/how-to-setup-python-code-reviews-with-coderabbit) can make things much more efficient and help us keep code consistent. And they're constantly getting better, learning from how developers use them to give more helpful, context aware feedback.

These tools allow development teams to work more smoothly, maintain high code quality, and free up their time to focus on interesting and challenging problems.
