> AI has changed how we code. Since GitHub Copilot launched, many AI coding tools have emerged. These tools make coding faster and help beginners learn more efficiently.
> This article will discuss two popular coding assistants, why you should use them, and how to decide which one best suits your needs.

## Overview of Cody and Cursor

**Cody:** Developed by Sourcegraph, Cody is an AI coding assistant designed for deep code search and extensive repository management.

**Cursor:** Made by Anysphere, Cursor is an AI coding editor based on VS Code that offers real-time code generation and session-aware help.

---

## Feature Comparison

While Cody and Cursor share many features, they differ in AI capabilities, context handling, and integration.

### AI Capabilities

Although they take different approaches, Cody and Cursor are designed to help developers with coding, debugging, and increasing productivity.

**Cody**

- Built around Sourcegraph, its parent company, it is strong in code search across large repositories.
- Works well with legacy or large codebases.
- Includes chat functionalities.
- Focuses more on search than code completion.

**Cursor**

- Strong autocomplete tool that finishes code based on recent changes (the "Tab" feature)
- Includes chat functionalities that allow users to ask questions about their code.
- It offers edit functionality that enables it to modify code directly.
- Supports image uploads with prompts to provide visual context

### Context Handling and Integration

**Cody**

- Deep Sourcegraph integration with excellent search-based assistance
- Works with multiple IDEs, including JetBrains and Atom, as an extension
- Can answer questions like "Where is this function used?" or "What does this API do?"
- Provides repository-wide context but lacks real-time session awareness

**Cursor**

- Allows users to manually select files and symbols to provide context to the AI.
- It functions as an AI coding editor, a clone of VS Code. This makes it familiar for VS Code users but less ideal for those who prefer other IDEs.
- Remember your work within a session.
- It can edit files directly and track conversations across different projects.
- Strong at local file interactions but weaker at repository-wide searches

**Why Does This Matter?**

The right AI coding assistant depends on both its features and your specific needs.

- **Cody** is ideal if you work on a large, existing codebase, prefer using IDEs other than VS Code, or need repository-wide searching powered by Sourcegraph. It is also a great choice if your team already uses Sourcegraph and requires large-scale code intelligence.
- **Cursor** is best suited for developers who prefer session-aware coding and debugging. Since it mirrors VS Code, it is an excellent option for those already comfortable with that environment. Cursor’s Tab feature makes it fast, snappy, and accurate within an active session or project.

> Cursor is stronger than Cody in terms of general coding assistance due to its real-time session awareness and powerful autocomplete capabilities.

## Real-World Use Cases

Let’s compare Cody and Cursor in practical scenarios to understand their effectiveness better.

### Debugging a Function with AI Chat

Here's a buggy JavaScript function:

```javascript
function getEvenNumbers(numbers) {
  return numbers.filter((num) => num % 2)
}

console.log(getEvenNumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))

// Expected output: [2, 4, 6]
// Actual output: [1, 3, 5]
```

**Solution with Cody**

```javascript
function getEvenNumbers(numbers) {
  return numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0)
}

console.log(getEvenNumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))
// Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

**Solution with Cursor**

```javascript
function getEvenNumbers(numbers) {
  return numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0)
}

// ... existing code ...
```

### Autocomplete: Writing a Factorial Function

**Cody:** You will need to type more manually before completing the function

```javascript
function fatorial(n) {
  if (n == 1) {
    return 1
  } else {
    return n * fatorial(n - 1)
  }
}

console.log(fatorial(5))
```

**Cursor:** Provides suggestions instantly upon typing the first few letters of the function.

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1)
}

console.log(factorial(5))
```

### Refactoring for Performance

Given an O(n²) time complexity function:

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(arr) {
  let result = []
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (!result.includes(arr[i])) {
      result.push(arr[i])
    }
  }
  return result
}
```

Both Cody and Cursor optimized it to:

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(arr) {
  return [...new Set(arr)]
}
```

### Creating UI Code from an Image

Below is the original landing page design you will attempt to recreate:

<Image src={UIImage} alt="Landing Page Design" />

**Cody:** Since Cody does not accept image uploads, you must provide a detailed text description of the design.

Example Prompt:

> "Build a landing page using HTML and CSS with two different background colours (#111111 and #BEB1F5) blending. The main text should say ‘Make Payments Easy and Simplify Your Finances’ in all caps, with smaller text saying ‘A new way to make payments easy, reliable, and secure. Manage all transactions from your phone.’ A phone image should share grid space with the text."

Outcome:

<Image src={CodyOutcome} alt="Cody Outcome" />

**Cursor:** Accepts image uploads, allowing you to provide visual context to the AI.

**Cursor**

It supports image uploads, making UI recreation easier:

1. Upload the design image
2. Prompt:
   > "Build this landing page using HTML and CSS."

Outcome:

<Image src={CursorOutcome} alt="Cursor Outcome" />

Cursor generates a more visually accurate landing page than Cody, where results depend on how well the design is described.

## Automating for Larger Projects

A good edit-and-test loop helps AI work better. The AI should write code, create tests, run them, and fix errors.

### Cursor’s workflow

**Step 1 - Docs for AI**

Cursor's Agent Mode automatically looks for pertinent files, but organised documentation ensures consistency and minimises errors. You can provide the Cursor with clear instructions on best practices rather than relying solely on previous codes.

The documentation can be placed in a folder as shown below:

```plaintext
/docs/AI-guidelines/
  ├── testing.md
  ├── database-migrations.md
  ├── rate-limiting.md
  ├── controller-setup.md
```

**Step 2 - Ask Cursor to Generate the Code**

Below is an example of a command given in Agent Mode, using the documentation above to guide the AI and keep it on track.

<Image src={CursorWorkflow} alt="Cursor Workflow" />

**Step 3 - Ask Cursor to Generate the test**

Like the example above, you can instruct Cursor to generate a test for the code and include instructions or best practices in your documentation.

**Step 4- Enable Yolo Mode in Cursor and run test**

Yolo Mode allows Cursor to execute commands without asking for permission when in Agent Mode.

To enable Yolo Mode in Cursor:

- Open Cursor settings.
- Enable Yolo Mode under Automation Settings.
- Allow test execution without confirmation.

<Image src={CursorYolo} alt="Cursor Yolo" />

**Step 5- Prompt Cursor to run the test**

After enabling the Yolo, you can prompt Cursor to run the test and correct any error if there is a failing test.

After enabling Yolo Mode, you can prompt Cursor to run the test and correct any errors if a test fails.

**Prompt to Cursor:**

> Run npm test and fix any failing tests automatically."

### Cody’s Workflow

**Step 1 - Docs for AI**

You must manually provide AI-specific documentation to guide Cody's responses, as it lacks an equivalent to Cursor's Agent Mode.

```plaintext
/docs/AI-guidelines/
  ├── testing.md
  ├── database-migrations.md
  ├── rate-limiting.md
  ├── controller-setup.md
```

**Step 2 - Ask Cody to Generate the Code**

With the AI docs guidelines, you can ask Cody to generate code.

Example Prompt:

> "Create an Express.js rate limiter middleware following the guideline @rate-limiting.md"

**Step 3 - Generate Unit Tests Using Cody**

Just like before, you can instruct Cody to generate a test for the code and also include instructions or best practices in your docs.

**Step 4 - Manually Run Tests and Debug Errors**

Since Cody does not automatically execute tests like Cursor, you must run them manually.

If a test fails, ask Cody:

> "Explain why this test is failing and suggest fixes."

Cursor automates more steps than Cody, making it better for iterative development.
