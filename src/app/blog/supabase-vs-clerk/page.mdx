This is the fourth post in a series of **awesome developer tools** I intend to write about. In the last 3 posts I talk about Neon, Supabase, Postgres and MongoDB it’s worth revisiting:

1. [Neon Postgres vs. Supabase](https://www.devtoolsacademy.com/blog/neon-vs-supabase)
2. [MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL](https://www.devtoolsacademy.com/blog/mongoDB-vs-postgreSQL)
3. [State of Databases for Serverless in 2024](https://www.devtoolsacademy.com/blog/state-of-databases-2024)

Today I want to talk about `auth` which is one of the most critical component of any app. Whether you’re building a simple web app or a full-scale app, ensuring that users can securely log in and manage their accounts is essential.

And based on all the feedback—and a good amount of time spent in developer communities, Twitter and Reddit — I’ve picked out 2 popular options for `authentication`: Supabase and Clerk.

> In this article, let's take a detailed look at Supabase Auth and Clerk Auth, I'll focus on their offerings, and how you can implement them with a `React frontend` and `.NET backend`.
> By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of which solution may work best for you.

If you don’t have time to read and want to jump straight to the code, check out the [demo](https://github.com/tyaga001/supabase-clerk-auth-demo).

## What is Clerk

> Clerk is a developer-first authentication platform, designed for apps where user management and complex workflows are required.
> Clerk goes beyond simple user auth, offering features like user profile management, session management, and fine-grained permissions.

## What is Supabase

> Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, offering various backend services, including authentication, real-time databases, and storage. Supabase’s authentication system is built on **PostgreSQL** and integrates well with the rest of the Supabase ecosystem.

## On Features

### Supabase

**Key Features of Supabase Auth**:

- **Email/Password Authentication** - Supabase provides traditional `email/password` auth with verification links.

- **OAuth Providers** - Support for social login through `Google`, `Facebook`, `GitHub`, and other `OAuth` providers.

- **Magic Links** - Passwordless auth using `email-based` magic links.

- **Secure Session Management** - Supabase securely handles `sessions` with access `tokens` and refresh tokens.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Users can be assigned `roles`, and `permissions` can be managed using policies in the `PostgreSQL` database.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** - With third-party integrations, `MFA` can be enabled for added security.

### Clerk

**Key Features of Clerk**:

- **Email/Password Authentication** - Similar to Supabase, Clerk supports traditional `email/password` authentication.

- **Social Login** - Supports a wide variety of `OAuth` providers, including `Google`, `Facebook`, `Twitter`, `GitHub`, and more.

- **Magic Links and Passwordless Login** - Clerk allows users to log in with `magic links`, providing a smooth, `passwordless` experience.

- **Session Management** - Clerk offers built-in `session` management, with support for multiple active sessions and session revocation.

- **User Profile Management** - Clerk provides `APIs` for managing detailed user `profiles`, including `avatars`, `email addresses`, and phone numbers.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** - Clerk natively supports `MFA` for enhanced security.

- **Customizable User Flows** - Clerk gives developers full control over the `user onboarding` experience, from sign-ups to custom redirect flows.

- **Clerk SDKs** - Clerk has official SDKs for `React`, `Next.js`, and other frontend frameworks, as well as backend integration for `Node.js`, `.NET`, and others.

Next, let’s set them up in local and see a live demo.

## On Setup

> **Supabase** - You can sign up via **GitHub** or **SSO**.

<Image src="/images/img_21.png" alt="Supabase" width={1200} height={600} />

> **Clerk** - You can sign up via **GitHub**, **Google** or an **Existing email/password combination**.

<Image src="/images/img_22.png" alt="Clerk-Auth" width={1200} height={600} />

In this article, I've used my GitHub account to sign up to both **Supabase** and **Clerk**.

### Supabase

Once you sign up and authorize Supabase to use the **GitHub account**, You will be asked to create an organization.

<Image src="/images/img_23.png" alt="Supabase-Org" width={1200} height={600} />

- **Name of the Org** - can be a valid company/individual name, I have provided the name as “MyXYZCompany”.

- **Type of Org** - Personal for learning purposes

- **Plan** - Free

Once you set up the org, you'll get a prompt to add a project - here's what that looks like:

<Image
  src="/images/img_24.png"
  alt="Supabase-Create-Account"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

- **Organization** - The current org will be pre-populated

- **Project Name** - Provide a meaningful project name

- **Database Password** - Either provide a strong password, or click on Generate a password, make sure to copy this password somewhere secure, this is used to access the `PostgreSQL` DB

- **Region** - Select the region closest to you

Just give it a minute to set up, and boom - your Dashboard will pop up.

<Image
  src="/images/img_25.png"
  alt="Supabase-Dashboard"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

You can see the `API keys` and settings at **Project Settings -> Configuration -> API**

These are important URLs and keys that you are going to use further in the demo.

<Image
  src="/images/img_26.png"
  alt="Supabase-API-Keys"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

Next, let's setup Clerk.

### Clerk

After you sign up to Clerk, You get the below screen to create an app.

- Provide an `app name, by default Clerk provides **Email** and **Google** providers.

> When you add Clerk auth to your app, you'll get a simple sign-in screen with `Email` and `Google` as default options. Don't worry - you can always add more sign-in methods later if you want.

Let’s use the default options and create the app.

<Image
  src="/images/img_27.png"
  alt="Clerk-Login-Page"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

> Great - You've created your Clerk app and now you'll see your shiny new **Dashboard**.

<Image
  src="/images/img_28.png"
  alt="Clerk-Auth-Dashboard"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

You'll find all your settings, keys, and other important stuff in the **Configure** screen.

<Image
  src="/images/img_29.png"
  alt="Clerk-Auth-Configure-Screen"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

And there you have it - you're all set up with Clerk. 🎉

## On User Creation / OnBoarding

Next, let's create `users` in both **Supabase** and **Clerk** to start setting up the `Auth` components.

> I'll use my email (`thewritingwallah@gmail.com`) to create accounts on both platforms to show you how it works.

### Supabase

- Go to Authentication tab from the left sidebar -> There are 2 options available in the **Add User dropdown**

  - **Send Invitation**

  - **Create new user**

> At the moment for default Email provider scenario for Send Invitation option, Supabase has restricted the authentication emails to org specific email addresses. So if we use the Send Invitation option for our test gmail user, it is going to fail.

<Image
  src="/images/img_31.png"
  alt="Supabase-default-emails-provider"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

> more info on this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29370)

so hit the `Create` new user and fill in the details.

<Image
  src="/images/img_32.png"
  alt="Supabase-create-new-users"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

You can see user in the dashboard.

<Image
  src="/images/img_33.png"
  alt="Supabase-new-user-dashboard"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

Next, let’s see creation/onboarding of `users` in Clerk.

### Clerk

let’s head over to the `Users` page.

> You’ll see we can either `Create` a user right from the dashboard or `Invite` one.

<Image
  src="/images/img_34.png"
  alt="Clerk-Create-Users"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

> Let’s create a user -> fill in the details -> Check the Ignore password policies checkbox for simplicity purposes.

<Image
  src="/images/img_35.png"
  alt="Clerk-How-to-create-a-user"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

The user gets added to the platform instantly.

<Image
  src="/images/img_36.png"
  alt="Clerk-user-dashboard"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

Both Clerk and Supabase make adding `users` simple and quick.

## On Front End Integration - React

Next, let's integrate both Supabase and Clerk Auth in a `React` app.

### Supabase

Let’s create a new vite `React` app.

```bash
npm create vite@latest ./
```

Supabase provides an auth library specifically for React - check out the docs [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/quickstarts/react).

Let’s install the required supabase libraries in the `React` app

```typescript
npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/auth-ui-react @supabase/auth-ui-shared
```

> Let’s create routes - `Home`, `Login`, `Success`, `hook` up the react router and create a basic app.

`App.jsx`

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Login from "./components/login";
import Success from "./components/success";
import Home from "./components/home";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Router>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
          <Route path="/success" element={<Success />} />
        </Routes>
      </Router>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

> Grab the **Supabase Project URL** and **Project API Key** from your Supabase dashboard, and drop them into the **.env.local** file in your React app. This will set up the Supabase client, which we’ll use to handle user authentication.

These are available at **Project Settings -> Configuration -> API**

Now, let’s add the authentication in the `Login` component:

<Image
  src="/images/img_37.png"
  alt="Supabase-API-Configuration"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

Next, add `auth` in the Login component.

```typescript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import { Auth } from "@supabase/auth-ui-react";
import { ThemeSupa } from "@supabase/auth-ui-shared";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabasePublicKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_KEY;
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabasePublicKey);

const Login = () => {
  const [event, setEvent] = useState("");
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(async (event) => {
      console.log(event);
      if (event === "SIGNED_IN") {
        setEvent(event);
        navigate("/success");
      } else {
        setEvent(event);
        navigate("/login");
      }
    });
  }, [event]);

  return (
    <>
      <div className="container">
        <h1 className="center">Login</h1>
        <Auth
          supabaseClient={supabase}
          appearance={{ theme: ThemeSupa }}
          providers={["github"]}
          theme="dark"
        />
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default Login;

```

Let’s break down what’s happening in the Login component:

- First, we import **createClient**, **Auth**, and **ThemeSupa** from the Supabase libraries we installed earlier.

- **createClient** needs the **project URL** and **project public key** to initialize.

- In the **useEffect** hook, we check if the user is logged in using **_supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()_** and navigate to the appropriate routes accordingly.

- Supabase offers a built-in **\<Auth />** component, which accepts **supabaseClient**, **appearance**, **providers**, and **theme** as props.

- **supabaseClient** is the object we get from calling **createClient**.

- **appearance** lets us set a Supabase theme for the UI.

- **providers** is an array where we can configure OAuth providers like GitHub, Google, Twitter, and more.

Alright, let’s run the app.

```bash
cd supabse-react
npm run dev
```

and click on login button and you'll see a supabase theme page.

<Image
  src="/images/img_38.png"
  alt="Supabase-React-App-Local"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

The Supbase’s pre-built **_\<Auth />_** provides the look and feel, and we don’t need to configure any styles for it.

Let’s create the **_Success component_** that we are going to navigate to post successful login.

```typescript
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabasePublicKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_KEY;
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabasePublicKey);

const Success = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [user, setUser] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    async function userData() {
      const { data } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
      if (data?.user) {
        setUser(data.user);
      }
    }
    userData();
  }, []);

  async function logOut() {
    await supabase.auth.signOut();
    navigate("/login");
  }

  return (
    <>
      {Object.keys(user).length !== 0 ? (
        <>
          <h1>Success</h1>
          <button onClick={logOut}>LogOut</button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <h1>User is not logged in</h1>
          <button onClick={() => navigate("/")}>Go back to home</button>
        </>
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default Success;
```

Let’s walk through what’s going on in the Success component:

- In the **useEffect** hook, we are trying to set the authenticated user details so that we can find whether he/she has been authenticated or not.

- If the user details exist, we will display the Success header, along with a logout button, else we will display “**user is not logged in**” message, along with the “**Go back to home**” link. This check will also prevent unauthenticated browsing of the success URL directly from the browser.

- In the logout function, we call the **supabase.auth.signout()** function and it logouts the user.

Let’s login with the test user (`thewritingwallah@gmail.com`) that we had created earlier.

<Image
  src="/images/img_39.png"
  alt="Supabase-Local-React-APp"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>
The Supabase authentication with React works great and is super simple.

Now, let’s get started with setting up Clerk authentication in our `React` app.

### Clerk

Let’s create another `React` app to integrate Clerk Auth.

> Clerk provides us with built in components like **\<SignInButton />, \<UserButton /> \<SignedIn />, \<SignedOut />** etc to help in the integration.

We need to grab the **Publishable Key** from the Clerk dashboard and add it to our **.env.local** file for authentication.

You can find this key under **Configure -> Developers -> API Keys**.

<Image
  src="/images/img_40.png"
  alt="Clerk-API-Keys-Dashboard"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

#### Importing Clerk Dependencies

Let’s import the Clerk dependencies in the app.

> You can find the details about the required dependencies in the [documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/react#react-quickstart).

```bash
npm install @clerk/clerk-react
```

Now, we need to add the reference to the publishable key in the main component and wrap the code inside a **_\<ClerkProvider />_** component.

> **ClerkProvider** expects the **publishableKey** and **afterSignOutUrl** as props.

```typescript
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.jsx";
import "./index.css";
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;
if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key");
}

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY} afterSignOutUrl="/">
      <App />
    </ClerkProvider>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

Now, let’s hook up the auth in the `App` component.

```typescript
import "./App.css";
import {
  SignedIn,
  SignedOut,
  SignInButton,
  UserButton,
} from "@clerk/clerk-react";

import Success from "./components/success";
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Clerk Auth</h1>
      <header>
        <SignedOut>
          <SignInButton />
        </SignedOut>
        <SignedIn>
          <UserButton />
          <Success />
        </SignedIn>
      </header>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Let’s break down what’s happening in the code:

- We import the pre-built **SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton, SignInButton** from clerk React library.

- We wrap **SignInButtton** inside **SignedOut** component, which means it will show the sign-in button only when the user isn’t logged in.

Now, let’s run the app and click on the `SignIn` button.

<Image
  src="/images/img_41.png"
  alt="Clerk-SignIn-Page"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

Let’s enter the test user we created on the Clerk dashboard: `thewritingwallah@gmail.com`, and then click **Continue**. After that, enter the password and click **Continue**. If everything goes well, you’ll see a success message and be taken to the next page.

<Image
  src="/images/img_42.png"
  alt="Clerk-Auth-Page-Success"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

The **_\<UserButton />_** component shows up, and when you click on it, you can see the basic details of your account.

Clerk authentication with `React` is super smooth and really easy to set up.

## On Backend Integration - .NET 8 Web APIs

We’ve learned how to integrate our React apps with both Supabase and Clerk.

But just the front end isn’t enough; we always need a backend to support a data-driven app. So, let's look at how Supabase and Clerk fit into the backend.

In this section, let's build a sample **.NET 8 Web APIs**, secure them with Supabase and Clerk auth, and call those protected APIs from our secure React front end.

Let’s keep building.

### Supabase

Let’s create a new `.NET 8` Web API app.

```bash
dotnet new webapi
```

We’ll be using the below `Nuget` package to work with the Supabase `JWT` tokens.

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer --version 8.0.8
```

Let’s open the `Program.cs` file of the web api solution and add support for `JWT` auth.

```java
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
            var configuration = builder.Configuration;

            // Add services to the container.

            builder.Services.AddControllers();
            // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle
            builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
            builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

            builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                .AddJwtBearer(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =>
                {
                    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
                    {
                        ValidateAudience = true,
                        ValidateIssuer = true,
                        ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
                        ValidIssuer = configuration["SupabaseSettings:Issuer"],
                        ValidAudience = configuration["SupabaseSettings:Audience"],
                        IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(configuration["SupabaseSettings:SecretKey"]))
                    };
                });

            builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
            {
                options.AddPolicy("Cors", p =>
                {
                    p.AllowAnyHeader().AllowAnyMethod().AllowAnyOrigin();
                });
            });

            var app = builder.Build();

            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseCors("Cors");

            app.UseAuthentication();
            app.UseAuthorization();


            app.MapControllers();

            app.Run();
        }
    }
```

Here’s what we’ve done:

- We’ve added support for JWT authentication using **builder.Services.AddAuthentication()**.

- The token validation now includes all the important parameters:

- **ValidateAudience** is set to true.

- **ValidateIssuer** is set to true.

- **ValidateIssuerSigningKey** is set to true.

- We’ve also specified the **ValidIssuer**, **ValidAudience**, and **IssuerSigningKey**.

- For **ValidIssuer**, we have **_“SupabaseProjectURL/auth/v1”_**.

- The **ValidAudience** is set to **_“authenticated”_**.

- For **IssuerSigningKey**, we use the JWT secret from the Supabase API dashboard.

> Just a heads-up - this is a **sensitive key**, so keep it safe and don’t share it or check it into source control.

Now, let’s add these settings in the **appsettings.json** file and use the **Configuration** pattern to get them in the Program.cs file.

```
  "SupabaseSettings": {
    "Issuer": "https://vcripehfbbgogiwvzbgo.supabase.co/auth/v1",
    "Audience": "authenticated",
    "SecretKey": "SECRET JWT KEY FROM SUPABASE DASHBOARD"
  }
```

Now, let's create a `ValuesController` and a protected GET endpoint “names”.

```java
[Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class ValuesController : ControllerBase
    {
        public class Employee
        {
            public int Id { get; set; }
            public string Name { get; set; }
            public string Department { get; set; }
        }

        [Authorize]
        [HttpGet("names")]
        public IActionResult GetEmployee()
        {
            var emp = new Employee
            {
                Id = 101,
                Name = "John Doe",
                Department = "IT"
            };

            return Ok(emp);
        }
    }
```

We would get a 401 UnAuthorized once we try to access the endpoint without an authenticated user.

<Image
  src="/images/img_43.png"
  alt="Swagger-UI-API-Test"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

We would need a token to access the endpoint, let’s integrate this API into the `React` app and use the authenticated user token to access the endpoint.

Let’s make changes to the `React` app success component to call the protected API.

```typescript
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import axios from "axios";

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabasePublicKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_KEY;
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabasePublicKey);

const Success = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [user, setUser] = useState("");
  const [token, setToken] = useState("");
  const [emp, setEmp] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    async function userData() {
      const { data } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
      if (data?.user) {
        setUser(data.user);

        const item = localStorage.getItem("sb-vcripehfbbgogiwvzbgo-auth-token");
        const parsedItem = JSON.parse(item);
        const accessToken = parsedItem["access_token"];

        setToken(accessToken);
      }
    }
    userData();
  }, []);

  async function logOut() {
    await supabase.auth.signOut();
    navigate("/login");
  }

  async function callAPI() {
    const API_URL = "https://localhost:7000/api/Values/names";
    const config = {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    };

    const response = await axios.get(API_URL, config);
    setEmp(response.data);
  }

  return (
    <>
      {Object.keys(user).length !== 0 ? (
        <>
          <h1>Success</h1>
          <button onClick={logOut}>LogOut</button>
          <button onClick={callAPI}>Call API</button>
          <div className="empContainer">
            <p>{emp.id}</p>
            <p>{emp.name}</p>
            <p>{emp.department}</p>
          </div>
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <h1>User is not logged in</h1>
          <button onClick={() => navigate("/")}>Go back to home</button>
        </>
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default Success;

```

We have a:

- **Call API** button, on the click of which we have a function **callAPI()**. We use **axios** to call the external API, We extract the user token from the local storage and bind it to the **Authorization** header of the API call.

- We bind the Employee details on successful response of the API.

Now, Let’s run both React/.NET apps and see them in action.

- Login to the `React` app
- Click on the Call `API` button
- The control comes over to the protected “names” endpoint on the `.NET` API side

<Image src="/images/img_44.png" alt="API" width={1200} height={600} />

API data successfully appears on the UI.

<Image src="/images/img_45.png" alt="API_Data" width={1200} height={600} />

So, we have successfully authenticated with Supabase in both frontend and backend. The logged-in user is able to access the protected API.

### Clerk

Let’s see how we can integrate Clerk auth in `.NET 8` Web API.

Create a new `.NET 8` Web API app.

```bash
dotnet new webapi
```

Add the JWT Nuget package to work with the Clerk auth.

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer --version 8.0.8
```

In the `Program.cs` file, add this code.

```java

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
using System.Text;

namespace Clerk.Auth
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
            var configuration = builder.Configuration;

            // Add services to the container.

            builder.Services.AddControllers();
            // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle
            builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
            builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

            builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                .AddJwtBearer(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =>
                {
                    options.Authority = configuration["ClerkSettings:Authority"];
                    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
                    {
                        ValidateAudience = false,
                        ValidateIssuer = false,
                        ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
                        IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(configuration["ClerkSettings:SecretKey"]))
                    };
                    options.Events = new JwtBearerEvents
                    {
                        OnTokenValidated = context =>
                        {
                            var principal = context.Principal;
                            var azpClaim = principal?.Claims.FirstOrDefault(x=>x.Type=="azp");
                            if(azpClaim is null || azpClaim.Value != builder.Configuration["ClerkSettings:AZP"])
                            {
                                context.Fail("AZP Claim is invalid or missing");
                            }
                            return Task.CompletedTask;
                        },
                        OnMessageReceived = context =>
                        {
                            return Task.CompletedTask;
                        }
                    };
                });

            builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
            {
                options.AddPolicy("Cors", p =>
                {
                    p.AllowAnyHeader().AllowAnyMethod().AllowAnyOrigin();
                });
            });

            var app = builder.Build();

            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseCors("Cors");

            app.UseAuthentication();
            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.MapControllers();

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

We have:

- Added support for JWT auth scheme using **builder.Services.AddAuthentication()** builder.

- The token validation parameters have all the mandatory parameters:

- **Authority** as Clerk project URL

- **ValidateAudience** as false

- **ValidateIssuer** as false

- **ValidateIssuerSigningKey** as true

- **IssuerSigningKey**

- AZP is Authorized Party = **_“http\://localhost:5173”_**

- SecretKey = The JWT secret from the Clerk API dashboard

<Image
  src="/images/img_46.png"
  alt="Clerk-Default-Secret-Key"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

> again a heads-up: this is a **sensitive key**, so keep it safe and don’t share it or check it into source control.

```bash
"ClerkSettings": {
    "Authority": "https://humble-rhino-42.clerk.accounts.dev",
    "AZP": "http://localhost:5173",
    "SecretKey": "CLERK DASHBOARD SECRET KEY"
  }
```

> Clerk Auth on .NET side is a bit different as compared to Supabase, it does not validate the audience or issuer, rather it validates and checks for the “**azp**” claim in the incoming token.

“**azp**” refers to **Authorized Party**, in our example we have set **Authorized Party** to “**localhost:5173**” which is the local home page of the Vite React app. Hence in the **OnTokenValidated** event, we are checking the “**azp**” claim in the incoming token.

Now that we have set up the auth on the backend, lets create a protected test endpoint.

```bash
 [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class NamesController : ControllerBase
    {
        [Authorize]
        [HttpGet("test")]
        public IActionResult Test()
        {
            return Ok("This is the response from the sample protected endpoint");
        }
    }
```

We get a 401 Unauthorized while trying to browse this endpoint as it is, without a token.

<Image
  src="/images/img_46.png"
  alt="Clerk-API-keys"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

Let’s update our Clerk `React` app to extract the access token and call the protected API endpoint.

```typescript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import axios from "axios";
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-react";


const Success = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState("");
  const { getToken } = useAuth();


  async function callAPI() {
    const API_URL = "https://localhost:7110/api/Names/test";
    const token = await getToken();
    console.log("token", token);
    let config = {
      headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer " + token,
      },
    };
    const response = await axios.get(API_URL, config);
    setData(response.data);
  }
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Success page</h1>
      <button onClick={callAPI}>Call API</button>
      <div>
        <p>{data}</p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};


export default Success;
```

We use:

- The **useAuth** hook from **clerk-react** that helps to grab the access token post successful login.

- We have a **Call API** button which performs an **axios** GET request and appends the token in the **Authorization** header of the request.

- We populate the div with the response of the API call.

Let’s run both the `React` and `.NET` apps and see how they work together.

<Image
  src="/images/img_42.png"
  alt="Clerk-Auth-Success-Page-React"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

Click on the Call `API` button, the control goes to the `.NET` end, and we see the “**azp**” claim in the incoming token that is captured in the **OnTokenValidated** event.

<Image src="/images/img_48.png" alt="Clerk-API" width={1200} height={600} />

Once the token validation is successful, we get a positive response on the UI. This means we’ve successfully authenticated with Clerk on both the frontend and backend, and the logged-in user can access the protected API.

**Both Supabase and Clerk are really easy to integrate on the backend as well.**

## On OAuth Provider Integration - Github

In this section, we are going to integrate `GitHub` login in our apps and see how Supabase and Clerk works against each other.

### Supabase

Click on **Authentication -> Providers** in Supabase Dashboard, and we will see an extensive list of various OAuth providers that Supabase supports.

<Image
  src="/images/img_49.png"
  alt="Supabase-OAuth"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

Let’s click on **GitHub** and add the details. We see that the **Callback URL** is pre-populated while **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields are empty. Where to get these details from?

<Image
  src="/images/img_50.png"
  alt="Supabase-OAuth-List"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

We need to create an **OAuth** app on **GitHub** end, and then we will get the Client ID/Secret that we can populate at Supabase’s end.

> Let’s go to **GitHub -> Login -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> OAuth Apps -> New OAuth App**

<Image
  src="/images/img_51.png"
  alt="GitHub-OAuth-Apps"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

<Image
  src="/images/img_52.png"
  alt="OAuth-Github-app"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

Register a new OAuth app.

- **Application Name** - provide a meaningful name

- **Homepage URL** - React app’s local home page url - localhost:5173

- **Application Description** - provide some meaningful description

- **Authorization Callback URL** - the call back URL where in the auth will fall to after successful operation, Supabase provides it, copy and paste it over here

After successfully registering the app, generate a **client secret** and copy both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** over to Supabase.

<Image
  src="/images/img_53.png"
  alt="Github-auth-demo-app"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

Let’s go to our Supabase React app and add **Github** as a provider, so that it appears as a login mechanism.

In the Login screen -> **\<Auth />** component, add the **providers** prop and mention “**github**” over there. **Providers** is an array that can include all the OAuth providers that have been setup.

```typescript
 return (
    <>
      <div className="container">
        <h1 className="center">Login</h1>
        <Auth
          supabaseClient={supabase}
          appearance={{ theme: ThemeSupa }}
          providers={["github"]}
          theme="dark"
        />
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```

<Image src="/images/img_54.png" alt="Supabase" width={1200} height={600} />

This is the only configuration that is required at the code end, let’s run the app and observe.

We see a Sign in with `GitHub` link on the React Login page, let’s click on it.

We see the `GitHub OAuth` Authorize screen, click on the Authorize button.

<Image src="/images/img_55.png" alt="Github-app" width={1200} height={600} />

We are redirected back to `localhost:5173` because it is what we have configured in github, and we see the token in the local storage of the browser, with the provider as github.

### Clerk

Let’s integrate `GitHub OAuth` provider in Clerk.

> Go to **Clerk Dashboard -> Configure -> SSO Connections -> Add Connection -> Choose Github from the dropdown.**

<Image
  src="/images/img_57.png"
  alt="Clerk-GitHub-OAuth"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

<Image src="/images/img_58.png" alt="Clerk-GitHub" width={1200} height={600} />

GitHub will be added as an ´OAuth` provider.

<Image src="/images/img_59.png" alt="Clerk-Github" width={1200} height={600} />

Let's run the `React` app and click the `Signin` button, we will see GitHub also as a login provider.

<Image src="/images/img_60.png" alt="Clerk-Github" width={1200} height={600} />

Click on `GitHub` link, and it will ask to authorize Clerk with the logged in `GitHub` user id.

<Image
  src="/images/img_61.png"
  alt="Clerk-Github-providor"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

Upon authorizing it, we will be redirected back to the Success page with the `UserButton` component populated.

<Image src="/images/img_62.png" alt="Clerk-AUth" width={1200} height={600} />

> This is the trivial way, the limitation of it is that every time we will be asked to authorize Clerk via github, to encounter this, we can click on **Use Custom Credential** option in **Github** in **SSO Connections** page. 

let's create a separate **OAuth app on Github**, then enter the **Client ID/Secret** at Clerk’s end, the same way we did for Supbase.

<Image src="/images/img_63.png" alt="Clerk" width={1200} height={600} />

Create a new `OAuth` app on GitHub, and copy the Client ID/Secret at Clerk’s end.

Upon click of the `GitHub` button on the Login Screen, the user will be prompted to the below Authorize screen and the login will be successful.

Let me recap and summarize all the key features I’ve covered.
